The speaker explains what ChatGPT is and how it works to generate responses to prompts given to it. He then mentions that ChatGPT uses an architecture called Transformer, which was introduced in a 2017 research paper. The speaker plans to train a Transformer-based language model using a condensed version of Shakespeare's works, called the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. The goal is to make the model predict the next character in a sequence, on the basis of the characters that precede it. He also states that similar work can be carried out with other text datasets. Additionally, he mentions that he has written code to train Transformers and created a repository for it on GitHub, which he calls 'Nano GPT'. He plans to write this from scratch in the video, to better explain how ChatGPT works. Finally, he mentions that he has downloaded the Tiny Shakespeare dataset in preparation for the demonstration.
