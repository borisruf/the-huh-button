In this context, the speaker is using Python, a popular programming language, to work with a text dataset. They are using a subset of William Shakespeare's works as a sample dataset, which is treated as a sequence of characters. Here, a sequence of characters simply means that we go through the text one character at a time. In Python, which the speaker is using, text information like this falls under the data type called "strings". The speaker plans to create a machine learning model that takes a segment of this text and predicts the next character that will come after it. By doing this, the model can learn the patterns and styles found in Shakespeare's writing.
