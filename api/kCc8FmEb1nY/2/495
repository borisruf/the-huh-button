In his explanation, Andrej explains a landmark AI technology, 'Chat GPT', which can generate text based on prompts given to it. He mentions that this AI system can provide varying responses each time, which is a way of it replying to the prompts. Towards the end of his talk, he expresses his intention to use the Tiny Shakespeare database as a dataset to train a similar system. He finishes by saying that 'Chat GPT' works in a way where it generates a text sequence based on given tokens (small bits of a word) or characters and that he will explain how the same concept will be applied while training his AI model on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
