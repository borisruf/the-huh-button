This lengthy explanation discusses the underlying mechanisms of the text-based AI system, ChatGPT. This AI learns to generate new words or characters based on a given sequence. The speaker suggests using a small dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' to demonstrate how to train a language model based on Transformer architecture, which is used in AI to predict the next character in a sequence. The explanation then touches on 'tokenization', a process that converts raw text into a sequence of integers according to a vocabulary. The speaker proposes to use a simple character-level encoding for the demonstration, as opposed to more complex schemas, for simplicity. The text from the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data will be encoded into a sequence of integers with a PyTorch library, creating a tensor - an important structure for neural network programming.
