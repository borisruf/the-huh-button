The speaker is discussing how to build a simple version of ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. They talk about how ChatGPT works, its language generation capabilities, and its use of something called the 'Transformer' neural network architecture. They emphasis that they are not trying to exactly replicate ChatGPT, but rather build a much simpler version to understand how it works. They decided to use a dataset made up of Shakespeare's works for training their language model. The sentence "Here, I open the "input," infers that the speaker has just started coding the language model on Google Colab.
