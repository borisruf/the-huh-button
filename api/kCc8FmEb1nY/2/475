The author is trying to explain how language modeling works using the example of Chat GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). This explanation is simplified and aimed at readers who may not have a strong technical background. The author is using a specific dataset called "Tiny Shakespeare" to train a transformer model. The transformer model will try to predict the sequence of characters based on the patterns in William Shakespeare's work found in the dataset. The prediction will try to mimic Shakespeare's style of writing, coming up with areas of text that "sound like" Shakespeare but are computer generated. The author is using Google Colab which enables sharing of the code for others to learn and follow along. He has started by downloading the Tiny Shakespeare data set and opens the "input.txt" file to read all the texts into the system. The "input.txt" file contains about 1 million characters.
