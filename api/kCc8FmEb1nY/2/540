Andrej explains that his goal is to help his viewers understand how the underlying system of Chat GPT, an artificial intelligence that generates text, works. He plans to do this by creating a simplified model based on the patterns found in a dataset composed of all Shakespeare's works, called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This model, called a Transformer, will be trained to predict the next character in a sequence of text, using patterns it identifies. He mentions that he has already successfully recreated a smaller version of Chat GPT using similar methods, and will be sharing his code with the audience so they can follow along.
