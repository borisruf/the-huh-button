In this explanation, the writer is discussing the AI model ChatGPT, which can interact and complete tasks based on text input. They explain that the model works by predicting sequences of words, characters, or tokens and responds to prompts with varying results. The speaker details their plan to build a simplified version of the system using the Transformer architecture, an AI model that has become prevalent in many applications. For their project, they decide to use 'Tiny Shakespeare', a dataset that compiles all of Shakespeare's works. The model will analyze character sequences in the dataset and attempt to predict their order. Once trained, it should be able to generate continuous Shakespeare-like language. The speaker notes that this process is similar to how ChatGPT works, using tokens or word fragments to create responses. They also mention that the model they're developing will be simple and digestible, aiming to explain how ChatGPT operates. The speaker takes the first steps by downloading and inspecting the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, identifying the number of unique characters, and creating a sorting system.
