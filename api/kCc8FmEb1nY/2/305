ChatGPT, or any AI language model, is similar to a game where you start a story and the AI must continue it. When you give it the start of a text or a story (this is called a "sequence"), the AI tries to predict and generate what comes next based on what it has learned from various texts. It's like filling in the blanks or completing a sentence, but for larger pieces of text. The fun part is that, since the AI is probabilistic, it can come up with different endings each time you give it the same start.
