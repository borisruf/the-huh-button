This is about an artificial intelligence (AI) program, specifically one called ChatGPT, that creates text. What it does is take input, or a 'prompt', from a user, like writing a haiku about AI or pretending to write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree. It then generates responses based on the patterns it has learned from the vast amount of text data it was trained on. 

The speaker explains that underlying this program is something called a Transformer, which is a type of neural network - a computer system modelled on how the human brain works. He explains that the program does not understand the meaning of the text, but looks at sequences of words or characters, and predicts what should come next based on the patterns it has learned. 

Then he goes on to explain a project where they're going to use a smaller version of the Transformer to create a smaller AI program. Instead of training this program on a huge dataset like the larger part of the internet, they're going to use a much smaller set, which is the collected works of Shakespeare, called Tiny Shakespeare. 

The AI program will predict the next character of the text based on the characters it has seen so far. So, when given a sequence of characters from this database, the AI program should be able to "guess" that the letter 'g' will come next. 

Afterwards, they can use the program to generate Shakespeare-like language. Even though these will be fake sentences, they will still look similar to those written by Shakespeare because the AI is replicating the patterns it learned from the Tiny Shakespeare data set.
