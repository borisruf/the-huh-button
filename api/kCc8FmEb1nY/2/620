This is describing how the complex computer program, ChatGPT, uses language to complete tasks given to it by users. The text is explaining that we can ask this program to do things like write a poem about AI. The program can provide different responses each time because it's made to predict and generate words in a sequence. It's basically a very smart typing machine that tries to provide the best response based around the question or the task at hand. However, the text is specifically talking about how the program is working 'under-the-hood'. It explains how the program looks at chunks of letters (or characters) and tries to guess what letters are likely to come next. This is done by training the program on lots of text data, in this case, all the works of Shakespeare. Later, when the program sees a string of letters, it uses what it has learned to predict more letters and essentially write its own 'Shakespeare-like' responses.
