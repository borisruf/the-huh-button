The speaker, Andrej, states that he intends to build a similar but simplified model to ChatGPT using a small dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He will train a Transformer-based language model to predict sequences using this Shakespearean data. Essentially, he wants to teach the machine to anticipate what character would logically follow a given sequence from the works of Shakespeare. Even though this is an oversimplified representation of how ChatGPT works, Andrej believes it can provide valuable insights about the inner workings of AI systems.
