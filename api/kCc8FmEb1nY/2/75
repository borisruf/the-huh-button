ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence technology that's quite impressive. You can ask it to do something, such as write a poem about understanding AI, and it pumps out an appropriate response. Even if you ask the same thing twice, the responses might not be exactly the same because this AI system can come up with many possible answers. This can be quite entertaining; people have had it generate quite funny responses to all sorts of unique requests. For example, some have asked it to explain coding to them as if they were a dog, or to write a pretend report about Elon Musk buying Twitter.
