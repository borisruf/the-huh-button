Andrej introduces the concept of a language model, specifically featuring a tool called ChatGPT. He explains that it's a system that can generate text based on given prompts, and that it's a probabilistic system, meaning it can produce different responses to the same prompt. He further elaborates that it operates on a Transformer architecture which forms the backbone of the program. It's a system that was proposed in a landmark paper in 2017, and its architecture has been applied to many areas in AI ever since.

Andrej plans to demonstrate how to build a simpler version of ChatGPT, although he emphasizes that they won't be able to entirely reproduce the original as it's a complex system trained on a large chunk of the internet. Instead, they'll focus on training a Transformer-based language model using a smaller dataset, such as the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which is a compilation of all of Shakespeare's works.

This simpler model will be trained to predict the next character in a sequence based on the characters that have come before itâ€”a similar process to how ChatGPT works on a larger scale. Andrej plans to present the entire process, from coding to training, in a series of video lectures and he encourages viewers to follow along by providing the code in a GitHub repository called 'nano GPT'. He emphasizes that proficiency in Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics would be helpful for viewers who wish to follow along.
