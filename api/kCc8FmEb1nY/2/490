The text is talk about ChatGPT, a language model using artificial intelligence that can generate text in response to a given prompt. This model doesn't necessarily provide the same response every time, but gives various outputs based on the given prompt. The text later extends its discussion to an AI chat model developed based on a research paper named "Attention is All You Need". Further, the speaker intends to prepare a simplified version of such a chat model using a toy dataset, Tiny Shakespeare, as an example.

Subsequently, he mentions a GitHub repository with code for training Transformers, an architecture often used in AI models, and talks about his plan to recreate this repository from scratch using Python. The model he aims to develop should be able to learn the pattern of characters in the Shakespearean text and predict the next character in a given sequence, generating infinite, fake text that resembles Shakespeare's style. 

Finally, he loads the data from the Tiny Shakespeare dataset into a Google Colab Jupyter notebook and shows the first 1000 characters of the dataset to explain that the text in Python is basically a sequence of characters.
