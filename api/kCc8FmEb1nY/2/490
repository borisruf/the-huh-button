Andrej explains that the system, ChatGPT, utilizes a language model that generates responses based on the sequence of words or language patterns used in the given prompt. The underlying technology for this process is a neural network called 'Transformer' from a 2017 paper. The important thing about it is that it predicts what comes next in a sequence of characters or words. In the video, Andrej plans to build a simplified version of this system, using a smaller dataset of Shakespeare's works. He explains that their system will also predict what comes next in a sequence of characters, mimicking Shakespeare in this case.
