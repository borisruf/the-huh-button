Andrej describes how a neural network called the Transformer, highlighted in a notable 2017 paper, is the key component to the function of ChatGPT. The Transformer helps ChatGPT model and understand sequences of words, allowing it to generate responses or complete prompts. He intends to demonstrate how the Transformer works by training a Transformer-based language model using a condensed Shakespeare dataset, thereby producing text that mimics Shakespeare's style. He likens the process to how ChatGPT does essentially the same thing, but with a larger dataset and more complex tasks.
