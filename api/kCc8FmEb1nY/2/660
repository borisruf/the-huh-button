ChatGPT is an AI developed by OpenAI that can perform text-based tasks, generating intelligible and contextually relevant responses based on a provided prompt. It can answer in multiple ways to the same prompt because it is a probabilistic system. The AI is a high-quality "language model," meaning it understands and mimics patterns within a language. In particular, this explanation discusses how the AI uses a "Transformer" neural network from a 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need." 

Despite its sophistication, ChatGPT is trained on a simplified model of data - in this case, the collected works of Shakespeare, or "Tiny Shakespeare." The AI learns to generate text by predicting the next character in a sequence based on the characters it has seen before.

ChatGPT can be implemented on other text data sets and the underlying code can be found in a GitHub repository, with a tutorial provided in the explanation. Tokens, or individual characters from a set of data, are translated into integers and back again for the AI to understand and reproduce textual patterns. However, this is just one example - many different encoding systems are used in AI, such as Google's "sentence piece" and OpenAI's "Tick Token" library.
