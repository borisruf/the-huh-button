The AI model, ChatGPT, interacts with users by generating text based conversations. One way ChatGPT works is by taking a string of characters or words (known as a "prompt"), then it generates a likely response or extension of that. 

In the example given, the speaker used an encoding method to turn certain pieces of text into a list of integers. The encoding was done character by character. For example, the phrase "hi there" is turned into a list of specific integers. 

They also mentioned a different kind of encoding system used by OpenAI and Google, which doesn't just consider individual characters, but instead looks at larger chunks or 'sub-words'. When OpenAI uses this system with something like "hi there", only three integers are produced, instead of one for each character.
