The speaker is an AI enthusiast explaining how an AI language model works. He talks specifically about a model called 'ChatGPT'. This AI takes a piece of text as input and uses it to predict what comes next. For instance, if you give it a sentence, it will work out the next word or phrase based on what it learned from lots of text data.

As an example, he uses a toy data set called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which consists of all of Shakespeare's works. He trains an AI model to predict the next character based on the preceding ones in a sequence from this data. Once trained, the AI model can generate text that looks very much like that of Shakespeare.

However, the AI model sometimes introduces some errors in the text generation process, hence the speaker apologized for the minor inconsistencies in the output. But overall you can see how the AI model operates letter by letter to predict text in a manner that mimics Shakespeare's language, which is quite impressive.
