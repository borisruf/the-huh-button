Andrej explains that they will be creating a simpler version of ChatGPT, an AI system that generates text. Instead of using the whole internet as source material, Andrej will use a small dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which includes all of Shakespeare's works. He will train a smaller Transformer neural network to predict what character is likely to come next in a sequence from Shakespeare's works. Andrej's goal is to show how the bigger, more complex system of ChatGPT works. He has already written the code for this project and shared it on GitHub under the name Nano GPT. In the given lecture, Andrej wants to recreate this code from scratch to demonstrate the process. He concludes by stating that to understand his explanation, one must have a proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and ideally have watched his previous educational videos.
