The speaker is discussing how to create an artificial intelligence language model similar to ChatGPT using the Transformer architecture. They mention a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which contains all Shakespeare's works. The speaker wants to build a system that can predict the sequence of characters in Shakespeare's works, for instance, giving a bunch of characters and predicting the next likely character. As an example of ChatGPT’s abilities, the speaker gives various prompts like "Explain HTML to me like I'm a dog", and "Please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree", and ChatGPT was able to generate interesting responses. The speaker has already prepared the code necessary to train the Transformers and made it available on GitHub under the name, 'nano GPT'. They're now about to open the "input file” as part of the demonstration in the Jupyter notebook.
