The speaker is explaining how they plan to create a basic version of the language generation model called ChatGPT. They propose trying to recreate a simplified version of it using a smaller set of data drawn from the works of Shakespeare. They'll be programing a system that can guess what character is likely to come next in a sequence from a piece of text. This is the beginning of building a language model that can generate text similar to how the AI system, ChatGPT, does. The complicated parts of the process include creating an architecture to house this language model and 'tokenizing' the input, which means converting the text into a sequence of integers or unique identifiers that represent each word or character.
