This is just describing how we build a vocabulary from the dataset. In this case, the "dataset" refers to all the written works of Shakespeare in a single text file. A vocabulary in this sense means all the unique characters that occur in this dataset. To build the vocabulary, the text is sorted into a list of all unique characters. The number of unique characters in this list is referred to as the 'vocabulary size'.
