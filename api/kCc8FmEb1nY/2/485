The speaker, Andrej, explains that he will create a model similar to ChatGPT using a smaller dataset, referred to as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He mentions that this dataset comprises all of Shakespeare's works condensed into a single file. He plans to train the Transformer neural network on this dataset, allowing it to predict the sequence of characters in a Shakespeare-like language. However, he clarifies that this exercise will demonstrate how the ChatGPT system works under the hood and not reproduce it because it's a complex professional-grade model trained on a significant part of the internet.
