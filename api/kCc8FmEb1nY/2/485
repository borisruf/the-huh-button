This is an explanation of how ChatGPT, a system that interacts with humans through text-based tasks, works. The system was created by a landmark AI paper in 2017, and is a language model that understands how words follow each other in the English language. The discussion goes on to talk about replicating the success of ChatGPT by using the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset, which is a collection of all of Shakespeare's works. The goal is to train a language model to generate text in the style of Shakespeare. The speaker plans to create a Transformer-based language model and use it to predict character sequences. The speaker also provides an online code repository where people can learn how to train these Transformers themselves. A short preview is then discussed, showing how the system can generate Shakespearean-style text. The speaker suggests that this understanding could be applied to other text datasets.
