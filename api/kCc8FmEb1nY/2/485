The speaker is explaining how he plans to build a simple version of a transformer-based language model, similar to the one used in ChatGPT, from scratch in a Jupyter Notebook. The transformer model will be trained on a small dataset called Tiny Shakespeare, which consists of all Shakespeare's works in a single file. After implementing and training the model, they plan to use it to generate text that mimics Shakespeare's style. Once the code is developed, they will share it with the audience through a link in the video description for others to learn from and experiment with.
