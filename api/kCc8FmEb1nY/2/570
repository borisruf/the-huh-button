The speaker, Andrej, is explaining how he is going to use a sample dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' to build and train a Transformer-based language model. 'Transformers' are a type of neural network used in artificial intelligence. He will use this model to predict the next character in a sequence from the dataset. He also mentioned a more robust and sophisticated model called Chat GPT, but clarified that he will not be creating an exact replica of it due to its complexity and vast training data. Instead, he will focus on explaining how Transformers work through a simpler implementation. He will eventually demonstrate how this model can generate text which resembles Shakespeare's works.
