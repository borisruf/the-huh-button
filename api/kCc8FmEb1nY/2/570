This paragraph is essentially explaining that while understanding the workings of Chat GPT (an artificial intelligence "chatbot") may seem complicated, one can simplify it by considering a smaller dataset. The author uses a dataset of all of Shakespeare's works, called 'Tiny Shakespeare', and is saying that they will train the AI model or 'Transformer' (term coined in the paper "Attention is All You Need") to predict what character (letter) comes next in a sequence of characters from this dataset. By doing this, they are hoping to show how the AI logic works in predicting and generating words, sentences, and further on, meaningful and contextually accurate responses.
