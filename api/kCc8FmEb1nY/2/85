So, an AI system called ChatGPT can be given a text-based task and it generates responses. For example, when asked to write a haiku about the significance of understanding AI, it gave two different but good responses proving itself a program based on probability. Same goes for other tasks, amusing or serious. Once, it was asked to write a news report about a leaf falling from a tree, and it presented it as a surprising incident.
