In the video, Andrej discusses a landmark AI paper that introduced the Transformer architecture, which forms the core of the language model used in an AI system called ChatGPT. Andrej plans to teach viewers how to train a simpler version of a Transformer-based language model on a 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. Despite not fully replicating the complex system of ChatGPT, he believes the process will be educational for understanding how these systems work. The goal is to create a model that can generate text or characters that resemble Shakespeare's style. He also mentioned an existing project called Nano GPT on his GitHub page, which offers a simple model to train Transformers on any given text. Ultimately, Andrej aims to make his audience understand how the ChatGPT system functions under the hood. Proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics are recommended prerequisites for this lesson.
