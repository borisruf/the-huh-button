Essentially, ChatGPT is a computer program that you can talk to and ask it to do writing tasks. The cool thing is that it will have slightly different responses each time you ask it the same question, as it operates based on probabilities. You can have a lot of fun asking it to do weird or humorous things like writing a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree. It's really good at this kind of stuff, which is quite impressive.
