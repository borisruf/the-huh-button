The speaker explains that he will guide the audience through building a simpler version of the AI system, Chat GPT, which is a language model powered by a neural network called Transformer. He'll train this model using a dataset containing all the works of Shakespeare, with the goal of making the system able to predict and produce character sequences that resemble Shakespearean language. But instead of using the entire internet data like the original, he has chosen to train it on a much smaller capacity. Ultimately, he aims to teach the audience about how 'Chat GPT', the AI system works.
