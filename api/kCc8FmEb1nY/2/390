This person is explaining how they used an open source version of OpenAI's GPT2, a machine learning model that's good at understanding and generating human language. They trained the model on a dataset called OpenWebText, which is made up of web pages. After training, the model was able to perform as well as the original GPT2. They also mentioned that they've written a simple version of this kind of machine learning model, which they call Nano GPT, that you can find on their GitHub page. This simpler model was used to learn and generate text in the style of Shakespeare.
