So, this AI called ChatGPT is like a very smart guesser. Imagine if you start telling a story 'once upon a time...' and somebody else continues and finishes the story. That's exactly what ChatGPT is doing. You give it the starting bit, say, 'Once upon a time,' and it continues the story based on what it knows and how it thinks the story should go. The story might change a little every time it tells it because it's a guesser and picks different options.
