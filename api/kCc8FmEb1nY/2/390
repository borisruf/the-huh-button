Andrej explains that ChatGPT is a computer system that uses artificial intelligence to complete text-based tasks. Just like an author writing a story, it generates sentences word-by-word from left to right. It was designed to predict how words follow each other in English. When given a starting point or 'prompt', it completes the sentence in different ways. So if you ask it the same task twice, you might get different answers. This is because ChatGPT is a 'probabilistic system', meaning it can provide multiple possible responses for each prompt given to it.
