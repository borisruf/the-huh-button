This is talking about creating a simple AI system, similar to something called ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a smart computer system that can write its own responses to things you ask it in text, like if you were texting back and forth with it. The way it comes up with its responses is by looking at the words you send it, thinking about the information it already knows about those words, and then guessing what it should say back.

In this example, the person is going to teach their AI system about the writings of Shakespeare. After spending some time learning from Shakespeare's works, the goal is for the AI to be able to write new sentences that sound like they were written by Shakespeare. 

The person has already written some computer code to help the AI learn from Shakespeare's writings. They are also using some information from the organization OpenAI to make sure their AI works properly. Once itâ€™s running correctly, the AI system should be able to create sentences that sound like Shakespeare.
