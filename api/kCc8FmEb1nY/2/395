This AI language model can generate unique responses based on the text you give it. By studying a bunch of text, it learns how words follow each other and can predict what comes next. I decided to do a simplified version of this using a data set of all of Shakespeare's works to predict how his characters follow each other. Although it can't match the complexity of a professional system, it's a fun way to understand how these AI systems work. I wrote these codes in a repository called Nano GPT, and you are welcome to check it out.
