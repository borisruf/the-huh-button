In this context, "I open the 'input'" refers to the process of accessing or loading a particular data file into a program or code. This is often the initial step in data analysis or machine learning algorithms where the raw data is loaded into the system before it is processed or manipulated. In this case, the 'input' being opened is the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data file which is going to be used to train a language model.
