Andrej wants to teach us how the language model called "ChatGPT" works. This AI system can take a sequence of words and predict what comes next based on its training, like how our brain finishes a sentence when we are talking. Think of it like this: if you hear "I am feeling...", your brain might think the next words will be "very tired". It's the same with this AI system. Now, Andrej won't be able to make a system as complex as "ChatGPT", but he will use a simpler version to help us understand. He will use a collection of Shakespeare's works as a training set for the system. Once it's trained, the system should be able to produce sentences in a similar way to how Shakespeare wrote. He intends to write everything from scratch to illustrate how the system works at the basic level for those who know some Python, calculus, and statistics.
