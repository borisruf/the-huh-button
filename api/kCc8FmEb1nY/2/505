In this very long context, the main character is creating a machine learning model based on artificial intelligence which can generate texts that sound like they were written by Shakespeare. He is teaching us how to do this step-by-step. The critical step mentioned at the end is that he opens a file named 'input.txt' which contains all of Shakespeare's works as text. He then reads in all this text and stores it in his program as one long string of characters (letters). A string in programming refers to a sequence of characters. Here, the word "read" means to input or load the data from the text file into his program.
