This is about preparing the data to train a language model. First, all the works of Shakespeare were gathered into one file. Then, each character essentially becomes an input for the model to learn from. 'Set constructor' is a function returning a set of unique characters in the text. The model aims to predict the next character based on the previous ones, effectively learning to generate sequences that resemble Shakespeare.
