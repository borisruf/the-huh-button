The individual is discussing a language model called ChatGPT, which is powered by a type of neural network known as the Transformer. This model can generate text based on provided prompts, predicting what comes next in a sequence with a certain probability. The model is good at generating informative or funny text, which can be quite different each time even for the same input. 

The individual is going to train a simpler, character-based version of this model using just the sum of works by Shakespeare. After training, the model will be able to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's language. 

This simpler transformer model was coded by the individual and can be found on GitHub. It is interesting because even though there are multiple ways to train transformers, this particular implementation is very straightforward and consists of only two files, each with 300 lines of coding.
