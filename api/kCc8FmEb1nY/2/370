In the video, Andrej talks about ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system which he refers to as a 'language model'. He explains how it understands how words are sequenced in the English language and generates text based on these sequences. He mentions that for any given instruction (or 'prompt'), ChatGPT can produce multiple different outputs because it probabilistically predicts the next sequence of words. Essentially, he's saying that when he gives the system the start of a sentence, it uses its knowledge of word sequences to complete the statement in various ways.
