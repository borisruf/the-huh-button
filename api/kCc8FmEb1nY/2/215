The speaker in this context explains that they plan on creating a simple version of a language model that works similarly to ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a powerful system that uses AI to generate different responses based on the text input you give it. It learns from large amounts of text data to understand how words follow each other in English. 

To give a better understanding of how systems like ChatGPT work, the speaker aims to build a 'Transformer-based language model'. In this case, it will work with individual characters, rather than words or phrases. This means the model will generate a sequence based on character inputs, rather than trying to understand the context of whole words or sentences.

Even though this proposed model is more simplified, it will still give an idea about how these AI systems function on a basic level.
