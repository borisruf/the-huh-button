ChatGPT is a type of artificial intelligence that can generate text based on a prompt given to it. Think of it like playing 'complete the sentence' game. You start with some words (the prompt), and it writes the rest of the sentence or paragraph. The cool part is that it can give different responses each time you give it the same prompt. So, it's a fun tool but also helpful for tasks like writing poems, explain big topics in a funny way, or even make up imaginary news articles.
