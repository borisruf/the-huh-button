In the video, Andrej explains how ChatGPT works. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence system that interacts with text-based tasks. This means, for example, when he provides a starting phrase or a prompt to the system, it can generate a variety of different responses or completions to the given prompt. He uses several examples to show that the system is probabilistic, suggesting that it can produce different outcomes even when given the same starting point. He emphasizes that ChatGPT understands how words follow each other in English and uses this knowledge to create meaningful sentences.
