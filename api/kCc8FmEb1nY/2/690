Andrej is explaining about ChatGPT, a conversational artificial intelligence. He describes how it generates responses to questions or tasks based on probability, which means it can provide different answers to the same prompt. He also explains that this system is known as a 'language model' as it can predict sequences of words in English. Andrej then delves into how this technology works, including how it leverages the Transformer architecture, which was proposed by an influential paper in 2017. He explains that this architecture is used in AI applications, such as ChatGPT. Andrej plans on teaching viewers how to build a simplified, character-level version of such a language model using a dataset containing all of Shakespeare's works. The purpose of this is to make the audience understand and appreciate how complex AI systems like ChatGPT operate. For this task, basic knowledge in Python, statistics, and calculus is required.
