The person is explaining how an artificial intelligence program, such as the one used in ChatGPT, uses a method that is a combination of encoding entire words and individual characters. Rather than symbols being translated into either whole words or single characters, this method encodes them at a 'sub-word' level. This provides a flexible way of understanding language that can adapt to different contexts and uses. This is the standard method used in most of these forms of AI programming.
