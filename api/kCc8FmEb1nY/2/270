ChatGPT is like a story-teller. You give it the beginning of a story or a setup (the sequence), and it carries on or finishes the story for you. It's like starting a game of 'connect the dots' and ChatGPT finishes the picture based on its understanding of the game. It might create different pictures each time because it has a lot of possibilities or ways to finish the game based on what you started with. It's kind of like if you started filling up a crossword puzzle and left it half-done, and then someone else comes in and finishes it based on what they think should fit in the empty boxes.
