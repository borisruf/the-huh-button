This is about a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model called ChatGPT. This AI can generate different types of text, such as writing a poem or a news article, based on the inputs or prompts it is given. This AI works by predicting what words or characters are likely to come next in a sequence, which it learns from a large amount of text data it is trained on.

In the given example, the AI will be trained on texts from Shakespeare's works. It works by looking at a sequence of characters and tries to predict what character comes next. By doing this over and over again, it will learn the patterns and style of Shakespeare's writing, allowing it to generate text that looks like it was written by Shakespeare.
