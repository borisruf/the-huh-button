Andrej is explaining a system known as Chat GPT, which he describes as a 'language model'. This system generates responses to prompts by predicting what words or phrases should come next in a given sequence of words. This allows ChatGPT to write unique responses to varying prompts, even when given the same prompt multiple times. Andrej also talks about an approach to training a simple version of this system using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' to generate text that resembles the writing of Shakespeare. He explains that by using this technique, the model determines what next character will logically follow a provided sequence. He emphasizes that this training won't produce a system as complex as Chat_GPT but it will help to understand how it works.
