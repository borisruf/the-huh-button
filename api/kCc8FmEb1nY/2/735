This teaching moment is all about understanding the workings of language models, like ChatGPT, which generate text-based responses to prompts. The plan is to build a simplified version of a text model using a compact dataset of Shakespeare's works. The first step involves converting the text data into a sequence of numbers using a process called "tokenizing". For this example, the tutor has chosen a simple encoding system that assigns a unique number to each character in the Shakespeare text. This approach is not typically used, but it keeps the lesson straightforward. Now that the tokenizing system is in place, the entire Shakespeare dataset can be converted into a sequence of numbers.
