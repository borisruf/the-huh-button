This person is trying to showcase a demonstration of the technology called "Chat GPT," an artificial intelligence system. It's a system capable of carrying out language-related tasks, like poetry writing, and can provide different responses to the same requests. They referred to this AI system as a "probabilistic system."

Then, they mentioned wanting to go through the technical aspects of making a simplified version of Chat GPT which works just like it. They intend to train a character-based language model using a smaller dataset named 'Tiny Shakespeare,' which contains all of ShakeSpeare's works. The goal is to make the AI system predict the next character in a sequence based on the sequence of characters it has seen. Finally, they mention that they have already written code for this and shared it in a GitHub repository called NanoGPT. 

Then, they end by stating their plan to demonstrate how to build this from scratch in a separate tutorial. This tutorial will be in a Jupyter notebook, and the code will be shared, so anyone can follow along. Before ending, they mention some preliminary steps that include downloading the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. 

Finally, they mention briefly opening the "input,", which probably refers to the beginning of the tutorial, where they will start working with the data, but this specific part is not explained in the context.
