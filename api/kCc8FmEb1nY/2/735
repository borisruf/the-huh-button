Andrej discusses how ChatGPT, an AI language model, works. He explains that the AI generates responses by predicting what comes next in a sequence of words or characters, based on its vast knowledge of how words follow each other in the English language. To help viewers understand this, Andrej suggests training a simpler model on a smaller dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare,' which contains all of Shakespeare's works. The simpler model, like ChatGPT, will predict the next character in a given sequence, resulting in generated text that resembles Shakespeare's style. However, unlike ChatGPT that works on a token or sub-word level, this simpler model works on a character-level.
