ChatGPT works using a type of artificial neural network known as a Transformer. This type of network is particularly good at modeling language because it can understand the context and structure of a text. It 'reads' through each word or character in a sequence, identifying relationships or patterns between words, such as which words often come after each other or the grammar rules that connect words. It then uses this understanding to predict the next word in the sequence. By doing this for millions of texts, the Transformer learns a comprehensive understanding of language structure, which it utilizes when generating text, like in the chat responses for ChatGPT.
