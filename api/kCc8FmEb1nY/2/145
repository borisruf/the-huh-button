The Transformer is a part of the AI model used in ChatGPT. It's a part that plays a significant role - it helps the AI understand and generate words or sentences that make sense in context. The Transformer concept was published in a very important AI research paper in 2017. So it's kind of like the brains behind how ChatGPT can write poems, articles, etc. based on the prompts given to it.
