Andrej is explaining how a system called ChatGPT works. He says that you can give this AI a text-based task and it will complete it. For example, you could ask it to write a poem or an article. Even if you give it the same task again, it doesn't always give the same result, creating slightly different responses. Essentially, you give it a starting point and the system completes it by predicting what should come next based on the patterns it has learned from the English language.
