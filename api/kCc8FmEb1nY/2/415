The speaker is going to demonstrate how to train a type of artificial intelligence (AI) called a "Transformer" to generate text. They plan on using a dataset called "Tiny Shakespeare," which includes all the works of Shakespeare. They will teach the AI to predict the next character in a string of text from Shakespeare, allowing it to generate new, Shakespeare-like text. They will start by creating a new, empty file and develop the AI piece by piece. Once it's trained, the AI can generate as much text as we want, almost like it's writing new Shakespeare works. The speaker says that this process could be applied to any text dataset, not just Shakespeare.
