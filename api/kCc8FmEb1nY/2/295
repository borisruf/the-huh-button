The speaker is explaining a feature of an artificial intelligence (AI) program called ChatGPT. The AI can generate text responses that resemble human language by predicting what word, character, or token should come next based on its knowledge of how words tend to follow each other in the English language. The explanation includes an example of how this AI was trained on a dataset of all of Shakespeare's works to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing style. There were some errors in the generated text, but the speaker reassures the listeners that the AI program is still able to generate Shakespeare-like language character by character.
