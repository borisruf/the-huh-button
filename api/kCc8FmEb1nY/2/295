This is part of a discussion about a program called ChatGPT which uses AI to generate sentences based on a variety of prompts. The speaker is explaining how they plan to create a smaller, simplified version of this AI. Instead of using large amounts of internet data, they will use the complete works of Shakespeare to train this AI. Once trained, this AI will be able to create infinite sentences that mimic the writing style of Shakespeare, even though the content may not make perfect sense or be accurate. The speaker is attempting to highlight the principles of how ChatGPT works by creating this mini version.
