The speaker is discussing how to train a variant of Chatbot GPT (Generatively Pre-Trained Transformer). They will use a smaller dataset, "Tiny Shakespeare", which includes all of Shakespeare's works combined into a single file of about one megabyte size. The speaker plans to model how these characters follow each other, for instance, predicting the next likely character in a sequence. They then plan to write this Transformer model from scratch. The speaker has opened an "input" which probably refers to a data file or a section of the code where they're feeding in the data to be processed.
