The commentator is discussing a language model program, which translates raw text into sequences. To achieve this translation, the program requires a tokenizer, a tool which converts raw text into numerical data. This can be done at word level, character level, or on a sub-word level. The commentator's model uses a character-level tokenizer which means it converts individual characters, including spaces and certain special characters, into integers. Other models, like Google's 'sentence piece' or Open AI's 'toktoken', use a sub-word tokenizer that splits words into smaller components to create numerical sequences. This can lower the quantity of integers needed whole expanding the variety of possible tokens. The trade off between vocabulary size and sequence length can greatly influence the efficiency and effectiveness of these models.
