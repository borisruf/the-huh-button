The speaker, Andrej, is explaining how he is using a smaller data set, called Tiny Shakespeare, to train a language model - a type of artificial intelligence system that can generate text. He demonstrates that once this training process is complete, the system can produce text that appears similar to the style of Shakespeare, predicting what character may come next in a sequence. The speaker also mentioned that he has provided the code for this process in a GitHub repository called Nano GPT, which can be used by others who wish to train a similar language model. Lastly, Andrej says he aims to help viewers understand how a more complex language model, like Chat GPT, works.
