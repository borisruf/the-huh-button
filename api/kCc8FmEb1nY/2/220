This means that, instead of training the AI model on a large volume of data from the Internet, a smaller, more manageable dataset will be used. Training an AI model with a massive amount of data could be complex, expensive, and time-consuming. In this context, using a smaller dataset might be more effective and efficient for understanding and demonstrating how these AI systems work.
