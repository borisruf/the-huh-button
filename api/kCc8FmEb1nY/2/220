ChatGPT is like a word prediction game. I give it a few words or sentences (the start of a sequence), and it predicts or guesses what should come next based on the patterns it has learned from lots of text it was trained on (completes the sequence). The result it produces can vary, making it more like a probability or chance-based game.
