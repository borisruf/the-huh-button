The speaker is explaining how to train an AI model called "ChatGPT" and is using the complete works of Shakespeare as the dataset. In this section, the speaker discusses how the dataset, which is a sequence of characters from Shakespeare's text, is converted into a sequence of integers. They call this process "tokenizing". To do this, they map each unique character from the text to a unique integer and store this mapping in a lookup table (also referred to as an encoder). They also create a reverse mapping (a decoder) that allows the original characters to be retrieved based on the mapped integers. This process allows the AI model to handle the text in a numerical format which is easier for it to process and learn from.
