This person is talking about working with a neural network called ChatGPT, which can generate replies to text prompts. It can come up with different answers for the same queries and can even write humorously about various topics. ChatGPT is based on what's called a 'Transformer' architecture from a paper titled "Attention is All You Need." This architecture is popular in AI and used in many applications. They now want to train a similar character-level language model using 'Tiny Shakespeare', a dataset of all of Shakespeare's works. They will train the model to predict the next character given a sequence of characters. They already have all the code needed to train Transformers and have shared it in a GitHub repository called 'nano GPT'. Now, they want to write this code from scratch and train it on 'Tiny Shakespeare' to help their audience better understand how ChatGPT works.
