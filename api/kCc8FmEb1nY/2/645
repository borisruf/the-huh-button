In his educational video, Andrej discusses an artificial intelligence tool known as ChatGPT. He explains that ChatGPT uses a system called a 'Transformer' to generate different responses to text prompts. Andrej says he wants to teach his viewers more about how these Transformers work, so they can understand the underlying mechanisms of ChatGPT. Rather than using the entire internet as a dataset for training the Transformer, which is what ChatGPT does, he proposes using a simpler dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare.' This dataset is a compilation of all of Shakespeare's works, which the Transformer will be trained to imitate. Andrej says that by doing this, the viewers will see how the Transformer generates text that resembles Shakespeare, and how this same process is used in ChatGPT to generate its responses. He shares that all the code needed to train these Transformers is accessible on his GitHub repository. To help his viewers understand, Andrej plans to write the entire code from scratch while using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
