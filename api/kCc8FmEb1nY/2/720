Andrej explains that he will train a simpler version of an AI model like ChatGPT using a text called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The AI model, called 'Transformer', will learn to predict the next character in a sequence based on the previous ones. After this training process, the AI will be able to generate text that sounds similar to Shakespeare. Andrej will demonstrate this process in a coding environment and share the code with viewers.
