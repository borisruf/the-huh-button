This text is about an AI system called ChatGPT. It uses a tool called a Transformers to generate text. An example is given where it can write something that sounds like news about a leaf falling from a tree. It explains how the system predicts the next word or character in a sequence based on the previous ones. The author then proposes using the works of Shakespeare to train the system, since they are complex but not too large. By doing so, they hope to make the AI generate text that sounds like Shakespeare. Despite being generated by a machine, this 'Shakespeare' text can seem quite realistic.
