In this context, it's explained how the "Transformer" neural network works. This AI system is used to analyze characters from a text, such as a line from Shakespeare, and it guesses what character comes next. This is done by learning from the patterns of how characters follow one another in such a text. Like if 'p' usually follows 'e' in the texts it was trained on, the Transformer would predict that 'p' comes after 'e'. In this case, the network is being trained on all of Shakespeare's works, so it will try to generate sequences of characters that resemble Shakespeare's writing style.
