In simple terms, this person is explaining how the AI system called ChatGPT works. To do this, they are using an example where they train a simplified version of the system on all of Shakespeare's works, which they have as a text file. They show that, using this "training" from Shakespeare's works, the AI system can generate text that sounds a lot like Shakespeare. They also show how this same process could work on a different text dataset, like a collection of web pages. This is essentially how ChatGPT is trained, just on a much larger and more complex scale.
