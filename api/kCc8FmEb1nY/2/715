Andrej explains that ChatGPT is a type of artificial intelligence system that uses natural language processing to perform tasks involving text. This could be answering prompts, writing a short piece of text, or predicting what might come next in a sequence. In the video, he emphasizes that he wants to explain how ChatGPT works under the hood. For that, he refers to a computer science paper called "Attention is All You Need" that introduced a structure called the Transformer. This model essentially predicts the next in a sequence of data based on previous information. A significant portion of the AI community uses this model nowadays. Andrej mentions that he provided the code he wrote to train these Transformer systems in a GitHub repository called Nano GPT. He also explains that for his example, he will use a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The aim is to train the Transformer model to predict what character comes next in a sequence from this dataset. This way, he hopes to show the audience how ChatGPT works and how they can apply it to other datasets.
