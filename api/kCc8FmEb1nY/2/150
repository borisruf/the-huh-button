The AI system, ChatGPT, is like a clever friend who can continue a story you start. You give it a few words or sentences (this is called a 'prompt'), and it will make up the rest of the story based on those starting words. The cool thing is, each time you give it the same starting words, it could come up with a different end of the story. This is because ChatGPT can think of many different ways the story might go, and it randomly chooses one each time. So, it's like throwing a ball and not knowing exactly where it will land - that's what we mean when we say ChatGPT is a 'probabilistic system'.
