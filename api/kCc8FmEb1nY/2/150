In this text it is explained that ChatGPT, a popular artificial intelligence program, uses a thing called a Transformer to work. The Transformer is like the brain of the AI that figures out how to make meaningful sentences. This concept was introduced in a special paper in 2017. It helps ChatGPT to produce different and often very creative responses to any text input or task you give it.
