The neural network that helps ChatGPT work is based on a design called the Transformer architecture. It was proposed in a famous paper called 'Attention is all you need' published in 2017. Simply put, it helps the AI understand the sequence or order in which words come. For example, it can predict the next word based on the words that came before. So, this architecture is crucial in helping ChatGPT generate intelligent responses.
