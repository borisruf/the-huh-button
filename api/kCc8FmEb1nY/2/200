ChatGPT is a program that uses artificial intelligence to generate text. It can be used for a variety of things, from creating poetry to writing news articles. Once it's given a task, it generates the text one word at a time. The results can vary each time the same task is given, because it's designed to provide a range of responses.

The technology behind ChatGPT is based on a system called Transformer, which was presented in a notable study in 2017. This system has been used in many AI applications since then.

But creating something like ChatGPT is not simple. It needs to be trained using a vast amount of information from the internet. This process involves multiple stages and is quite complex.
