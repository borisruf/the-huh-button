ChatGPT is an AI system that can carry on interactive conversations. If you give it a topic or a start of a sentence, it is able to complete the rest of the conversation or sentence in a way that makes sense. It can produce varying responses to the same prompt and its responses can be highly creative and even amusing. It is able to do this because it has been trained to understand how words are typically arranged in sentences in the English language. Therefore, given the beginning of a sentence, it can predict and generate what the rest of the sentence could be.
