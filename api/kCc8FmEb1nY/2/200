Andrej explains that ChatGPT is an AI system designed to complete a sequence of words that he starts. For example, he gives the system a prompt or the start of a sentence, and the AI finishes it in a way that makes sense. It can provide different possible completions for the same prompt because it's a 'probabilistic' system. This is why he refers to it as a 'language model' - it understands the structure of language and how words usually follow each other.
