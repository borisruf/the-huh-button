This text is about the AI system ChatGPT, which uses language modeling to generate human-like text based on given prompts. The explainer decides to demonstrate the workings of this system by creating a simpler, character-level language model. For this, they use 'Tiny Shakespeare' - a dataset containing all of Shakespeare's works in a single file. The goal of this project is to train the model to predict the sequence of characters in Shakespeare's text.
