Andrej is talking about an artificial intelligence system called ChatGPT. This AI can be given text-based tasks and it generates responses. He calls it a 'language model' because it can predict how words follow each other in the English language. For example, if Andrej gives it the beginning of a sentence or statement, the AI is able to complete it.
