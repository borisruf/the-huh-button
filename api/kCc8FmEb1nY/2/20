ChatGPT is a system that allows you to "talk" or interact with an artificial intelligence (AI). You can ask it to do things involving words and sentences. For example, you can ask it to write a short, three line poem called a haiku about the importance of understanding AI. People can then use this AI to make the world better and more successful.
