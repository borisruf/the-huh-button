Andrej in the video is explaining that ChatGPT is a tool that uses AI to generate text. When Andrej gives ChatGPT the beginning of a sentence or a scenario (which he calls a 'prompt'), it will complete the sentence or describe the scenario in a way that makes grammatical sense based on its understanding of how words follow each other in English. This is why it's called a 'language model'. He provides several amusing examples to demonstrate this.
