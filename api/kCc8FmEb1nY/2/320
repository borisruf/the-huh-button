ChatGPT is like a word magician. You give it the start of a word puzzle, like the first half of a sentence or a concept, and it finishes off the puzzle or sentence with the right words. It does this by guessing the best possible words that follow what you gave it. This is why sometimes it can give slightly different endings for the same starting words- there's more than one way to finish a sentence or express an idea.
