This is an explanation of how the AI program called ChatGPT works. It uses a system called a 'language model' to predict what word should come next in English sentences. A language model is a critical part of many AI systems that generate text, like writing poems or news articles. The speaker is using a smaller version of this AI that is trained to predict the next character (like a letter or punctuation mark) in a sequence from the works of Shakespeare. After it has been trained on this dataset, it should be able to generate text that sounds like it was written by Shakespeare, varying by the sequence of characters provided. The speaker mentions that while training, there might be some mistakes or 'junk' that the system can't figure out, but mostly it should do a pretty good job at imitating Shakespeare's style.
