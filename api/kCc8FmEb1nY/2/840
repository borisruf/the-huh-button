The speaker is explaining the process and steps they are taking in advancing their project. They discussed the "input" function in Python, which is used to take a user's input. In this case, they are using it to open the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset they mentioned earlier, and this dataset will be used to train a Transformer neural network for language modeling. The "input" is the data or information that the computer program or algorithm receives to execute a specific process or task.
