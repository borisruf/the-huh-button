Andrej wishes to construct his own very basic version of the AI system Chat GPT. The version he will build is more simplified, but it will still demonstrate how the system functions. Instead of using a massive body of data as Chat GPT does, he chooses to use a dataset he calls 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all the works of William Shakespeare. Andrej intends to use this system to predict the sequence of characters based on the patterns found in Shakespeare's works, resulting in phrasing that resembles Shakespeare's language style. His goal is to provide viewers a clear understanding of how the more complex AI system, Chat GPT, functions under the hood.
