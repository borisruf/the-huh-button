In short, this text is about the AI language model ChatGPT, which uses its understanding of language patterns to generate responses or create content based on a given prompt. It can produce varied responses to the same prompt, because it operates on a probabilistic system. The core AI model that drives ChatGPT is called Transformer, which was developed to predict sequences of words in a text. This person plans to create a simple version of a Transformer model that predicts sequences of characters from Shakespeare's works. The entire process will be written in Python and implemented using basic knowledge of calculus and statistics. It can also be beneficial to watch his previous videos explaining the process.
