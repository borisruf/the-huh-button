The speaker discusses ChatGPT, a type of artificial intelligence system that can create text based on prompts provided by the user. This system can come up with a variety of responses, often with humorous or unexpected results. It is based on the Transformer, a type of neural network that can predict a sequence of words.

In this specific tutorial, the speaker wants to show how to create a simple version of a Transformer-based language model, similar to ChatGPT, but on a smaller scale. They will use a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all of Shakespeare's works. They aim to train this model to predict the next character in a sequence, therefore reproducing the language style of Shakespeare.

The speaker has already written the code for this exercise and placed it in a GitHub repository, called Nano GPT. Their objective in this video is to begin from a blank file and walk through defining a Transformer and training it on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, with the ultimate aim being able to generate infinite text in the style of Shakespeare.

The prerequisites for following along are proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics and knowledge from the speaker's previous videos on language modeling. The speaker encourages people to follow along with the code in a Google Colab notebook, the details of which will be shared later in the video description.
