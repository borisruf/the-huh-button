In simple terms, Andrej is saying that ChatGPT is a sort of AI (Artificial Intelligence) system that, given a series of words or a 'prompt', can generate a sequence of words in response. These responses are produced because the system understands how words usually follow each other in English language. The result is not fixed; it can vary each time the same prompt is given. For example, if Andrej asks ChatGPT "write a note about Elon Musk buying Twitter", the system will create a text that corresponds to this prompt, based on its knowledge of language sequences.
