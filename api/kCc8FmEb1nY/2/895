The speaker is discussing a complex text regarding how artificial intelligence works, particularly focusing on a technology called GPT (Generatively Pre-trained Transformer), which is used for text prediction based on statistical models of language. The speaker explains examples of what GPT can do by generating sentences and explains how it works by modeling sequences of words or characters. The speaker further delves into the details of the architecture and inner workings of this technology and cites a landmark paper that introduced the idea. They plan to demonstrate how to build something similar using simplified code and a small dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. At the end, they mention they're about to open an "input" - likely to start discussing or demonstrating something needed for the coding and building process.
