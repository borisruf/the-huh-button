Andrej explained that ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence program designed to generate human-like responses to prompts given by users. The system is trained on a vast amount of data and is flexible enough to produce different answers to the same prompt. The underlying technology behind this AI is called 'Transformers', introduced in a ground-breaking paper in 2017. Andrej suggests that he plans to demonstrate how to train this kind of system using a simpler dataset based on the works of Shakespeare. The AI will learn to predict the sequence of characters in the text, gradually learning to generate text that looks like it was written by Shakespeare. Andrej highlights that understanding this process can help people to comprehend how complex AI systems like ChatGPT work.
