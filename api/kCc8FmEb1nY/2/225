Andrej describes how ChatGPT, an AI software, generates responses to given prompts. He calls it a 'language model' because it recognizes patterns in the English language and uses these to create responses. When given a starting point or 'sequence', the AI tries to complete it in a way that makes sense based on what it has learned about how words follow each other.
