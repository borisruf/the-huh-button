This person is explaining how Chat GPT, an AI system that can generate text, works. They go over how it can create different responses to the same prompt and provide some fun and interesting examples. They explain that it all works on the basis of a 'language model'; it learns how words in English usually follow each other. They then talk about the Transformer architecture, a system for modeling language that has been very influential in AI. They propose to demonstrate how this works, not by reproducing the whole of Chat GPT, which is very complex, but by creating a simpler version. For this, they suggest using a smaller and simpler dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'.
