In simple words, what I want to do is train a special type of AI model known as a Transformer. We'll use this to create a 'language model' - something that understands how words and letters come after each other in typical writing. In our case, we're specifically going to look at it on the level of individual characters (like 'a', 'b', 'c', etc.), not whole words. 

This type of model is what powers ChatGPT, which you may have heard of. It's an AI that can complete sentences in a human-like way, making it great for things like writing poems or articles, and it's become very popular in the AI community. 

But creating a model like ChatGPT is tough - it involves a lot of data, and many stages of training. So we're going to keep it simple and focus on just building a basic Transformer-based model that understands how characters in English writing typically come after each other.
