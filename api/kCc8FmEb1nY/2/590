Andrej is attempting to simplify and explain how a particular artificial intelligence (AI) system works. This system, known as a Transformer, is a type of AI that can generate language patterns similar to human speech or writing. It does this by predicting what word or character comes next in a sequence. Andrej is using a dataset containing all of Shakespeare's works to train this AI so it can generate its own language, similar to how Shakespeare would write. However, he acknowledges that the final output, while Shakespeare-esque, is a simulated replication and not actually Shakespeare's writing. Andrej plans to codify this process into a simple model to help others understand the under-the-hood workings of the AI system, requiring only a basic understanding of Python, calculus, and statistics.
