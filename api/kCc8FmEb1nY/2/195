The speaker is saying that while they'd like to build something like ChatGPT, they won't be able to exactly recreate it. ChatGPT is a very complex model which generates different responses according to different inputs. It involves deep and large-scale machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, meaning it's not an easy task to build from scratch or even imitate. So, they can attempt to build something similar, but they won't be able to replicate the exact system because it's a high-quality, commercial system that required significant investment, resources, and expertise to construct.
