Andrej ended his introduction by saying he downloaded a data set known as "Tiny Shakespeare" from a particular URL. He mentions that the data set is approximately one megabyte big and will be using this data to train the AI model he'll be demonstrating. This means he will use this compact collection of Shakespeare's works to help his AI learn, much like teaching a student using a textbook.
