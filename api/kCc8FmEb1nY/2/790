In this paragraph, the speaker is explaining how to turn text data into appropriate numerical data for machine learning processing. Using the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset, which contains the works of Shakespeare, they will convert each individual character of the text into a corresponding number, using a process called "encoding". This numerical data is then converted into "tensors" using the PyTorch library in Python for later use in a machine learning model. A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numbers, which is used in machine learning models to process data.
