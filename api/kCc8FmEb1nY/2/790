The speaker is discussing how an AI model can generate text by analyzing patterns and predicting the next sequence. In order to teach the model, he will use a set of Shakespeare's works, known as the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. However, before they proceed, the speaker wants to divide this dataset into two parts: one for 'training' the model and another for 'validating' the model's performance. This helps to test how well the model has learned and can make accurate predictions.
