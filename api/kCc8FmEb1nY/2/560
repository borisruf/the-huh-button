The narrator is explaining how a character-level language model is built. The model uses an artificial neural network called a Transformer to predict the sequence of characters in text. To perform this, the text is converted into a sequence of integers using a process called tokenization. The text used to train this model comes from the works of Shakespeare. The goal is to train the model to generate its own text in the style of Shakespeare. Importantly, the model is trained using only characters and does not understand or rely on whole words, making it a character-level language model.
