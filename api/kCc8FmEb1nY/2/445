Andrej explains that ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, is able to generate responses depending on the commands or prompts given to it. This system is seen as 'probabilistic', which means it can provide different responses each time for the same prompt, making the interactions diverse. This AI system is referred to as a 'language model' as it understands the English language sequence and completes a sequence based on the prompt given. Essentially, Andrej gives this AI system a starting sequence and it completes the rest.
