This video is explaining how ChatGPT works. ChatGPT is a text-based AI system that uses a language model to generate responses to given prompts. It can produce different answers each time a prompt is given because it's a probabilistic system. These responses are generated by a neural network called the 'Transformer', which was introduced in a 2017 research paper.

The video demonstrates the capabilities of ChatGPT by showing the humorous and diverse responses it can generate. It also explains how ChatGPT learns from a vast amount of internet data. The presenter plans to train a simpler version of this system, using a dataset containing all of Shakespeare's works. The system will learn to predict the next character based on prior ones. The presenter also briefly describes 'Nano GPT', a simple codebase he's created to train Transformers. The video will include a demonstration of creating a Transformer from scratch and training it.

The video's main goal is to help viewers understand how the technology behind AI systems like ChatGPT works. It requires some proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and familiarity with the presenter's previous videos on similar topics.
