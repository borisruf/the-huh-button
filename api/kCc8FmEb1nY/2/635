Andrej is explaining that he is going to demonstrate how to build a simple version of Chat GPT, the AI that can generate text, using a simple dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He is going to use the Transformer neural network model, which he explains was created in 2017 and is used to predict the sequence of words or characters. In this case, he'll demonstrate how it can predict what character is likely to come next in a sequence from the works of Shakespeare. He's already written code for this which is available on his GitHub but in the video, he's going to write it from scratch. This is so that viewers can understand how such systems work. Some knowledge of Python, calculus, and statistics is required.
