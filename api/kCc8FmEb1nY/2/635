In this context, the speaker is talking about beginning the coding process to create a Transformer-based language model similar to ChatGPT. When the speaker says "Here, I open the 'input'", he means that he's starting to work with the data that will be used to train the model. In this instance, the data is 'Tiny Shakespeare' or all the works of Shakespeare in a single file. "Open the input" essentially denotes the beginning of the coding or programming process where he'll start interacting with the data/input file.
