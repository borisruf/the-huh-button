Being able to translate a string of characters into integers and back again is important for natural language processing tasks, like those performed by AI systems like GPT-3. This is done by assigning each character in the string to a corresponding integer. These integers can be processed more easily by the AI system. After processing, the integers can be converted back into their original characters. This works on individual letters and punctuation, not on whole words or sentences, in what the speaker refers to as a "character level." This simplifies the task for the AI system while still providing meaningful output.
