ChatGPT is an AI developed by OpenAI capable of generating human-like text when given a prompt. This system is useful for tasks like writing haikus, explaining concepts, and even creating humorous responses to hypothetical scenarios. It uses Transformer architecture to generate these pieces of text. 

The speaker is also discussing a similar language model that uses the same architecture to generate text in the style of Shakespeare. This model, like ChatGPT, understands patterns in data and uses that to predict what comes next in a sequence of characters. 

The concept of 'encoding' is also mentioned. In this context, encoding means converting raw text into integers that can be processed by the model. The speaker is addressing different ways of doing this encoding. He mentions Google's sentence piece model, which is more complex than the character-level encoding he's been discussing but also has many real-world applications.
