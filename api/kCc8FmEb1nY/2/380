ChatGPT is like a helpful friend who completes your sentences. When you start a sentence or give it something to write about, it continues with the rest of the sentence or topic in a way that makes sense. It might not always write the same thing every time, but it always tries to make it interesting and relevant. No matter what you ask it to write about, it gives you a complete and coherent text.
