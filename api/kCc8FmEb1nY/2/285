We are going to teach a system called Transformer to produce sequences of characters that look like Shakespeare's work. We teach it by showing it large parts of Shakespeare's work and it will learn to predict the next character based on the previous ones. For example, if we show it "Hello, good mor", it will predict that the next character is "n", to complete the word "morn". This way, it learns to understand how characters follow each other in Shakespeare's work.
