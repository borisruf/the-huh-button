The speaker is talking about a system known as ChatGPT which is a type of artificial intelligence. This system can take a small piece of information, or 'sequence', given to it and then generate or 'complete' more information from it. This is done in a random or 'probabilistic' way, so that every time the same sequence is given, it can produce a slightly different result. This is useful for generating varied and creative responses, like writing a poem or a news article.
