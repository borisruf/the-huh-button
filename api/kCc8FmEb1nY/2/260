ChatGPT is like a sentence finishing expert. If I start a sentence or a series of sentences (the sequence), ChatGPT will try its best to finish it in a way that makes sense based on what it has learned about language and how words usually go together. The cool thing is, it can come up with different ways to finish the same sentence if you ask it more than once.
