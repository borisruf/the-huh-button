This passage explains how a character-level language model uses a transcription process to interact with text. It breaks down text like a book or a sentence into individual characters (like 'h', 'i' or ',') and then assigns each character a unique number. For example, 'a' might become 1, 'b' might become 2, and so on. These numbers are then used by the computer model to generate or process the text. The critical part to note is that this translation process can go in two directions: It can take a piece of text and port it into a list of numbers, but it can also take a list of numbers and convert it back into the original text.
