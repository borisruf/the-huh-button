In simpler terms, Andrej talked about a system called ChatGPT which works like an interactive AI that can perform text-based tasks. Then, he explained how the AI works - it uses a system called Transformer to generate text based on words or parts of words given to it. The key point is that it can produce different responses for the same input, mimicking how people might reply differently to the same question, making the system quite dynamic and realistic. He then demonstrated an example using a dataset of Shakespeare's works, showing how the Transformer was able to predict the next characters in a sequence. This same process can be applied to any given text. At the end, he explains his intention to guide viewers in building a similar AI using a programming language called Python.
