ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence system that can complete various text-based tasks you ask it to do. You can ask it to write a poem, a news article, or an explanation about something, and it will generate text based on your instructions. It works by creating sentences word by word in sequential order, just like how we speak or write. Sometimes, if you ask it the same question again, it might give a slightly different answer, because it relies on probabilities or chances to select the next word. This technology is called a 'language model' because it follows the patterns of how words are usually used in the English language.
