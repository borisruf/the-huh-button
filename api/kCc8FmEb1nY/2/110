The text is talking about a computer program called ChatGPT. It can generate text that sounds like it's written by a human. It does this by predicting what word should come next in a sentence. This program understands how words are usually ordered in English. So, when you give it a task, it fills in the rest of the text by guessing the most likely words to follow. You can ask it to do various tasks such as writing poetry, explaining things, or even writing humorous stories. Because it's making educated guesses, it might produce different texts from the same task each time.
