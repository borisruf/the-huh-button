When the speaker says the AI, ChatGPT, is completing the sequence, they mean that the AI is generating more text based on the text or prompt given to it. In simpler terms, think of it like finishing a sentence started by someone else. In the context of ChatGPT, it's like you're giving it the starting part of the sentence, and then it completes the rest in a way that makes sense based on the knowledge it has learned from lots of previous text data.
