In really simple terms, we're going to train a computer program to learn how words follow each other in all of Shakespeare's works. It will study every sentence, word, and character in those works, and learn how they typically appear together. Once it's done studying, we're going to test it by giving it a few words, and it would guess what comes next based on what it has learned from Shakespeare's pattern of writing. So if it works, the computer program should be able to generate sentences that sound like they could have come from a Shakespeare play.
