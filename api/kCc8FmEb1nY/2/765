Sure. The speaker is breaking down and explaining how Chat GPT, which is a popular AI text generator, works, and he is doing this by using the example of creating a similar but much simpler language model using the works of Shakespeare. 

The speaker explains that the AI in Chat GPT works by taking a prompt given by the user, processing the given information, and then using that information to generate an appropriate response.

The speaker further explains that the AI in Chat GPT works by modeling the structure of language - word sequences, punctuation usage, and even the way sentences are constructed. This modeling is done using a language model, which is, essentially, a mathematical representation of this language structure.

The speaker further discusses how the AI 'learns' by being trained on a large amount of text data, which in this case is from the works of Shakespeare. By studying this data, the AI learns the way different words often follow each other - in other words, it learns the "patterns" of English in Shakespeare's works.

Using this model, the AI can then generate new text that "looks" a lot like it might have been written by Shakespeare - it can predict what word is likely to come next given a sequence of previous words, allowing it to generate new sequences of words.

However, the speaker also highlights that, because the AI operates on a character level (i.e., it makes its predictions based on individual characters rather than whole words or bigger chunks), the resulting sequences can be very long.

It's important to note that the model does not truly understand the text in the way a human would - it doesn't know what the words mean or the nuances of poetry and dramatic language; it is only mimicking the patterns it has learned from the data it was trained on.
