In the last sentence, Andrej expresses his intention to create a miniature version of ChatGPT, a language model that generates text by predicting the next character in a sequence. He plans to train this miniature model using a condensed dataset, "Tiny Shakespeare," which contains all of Shakespeare's works in one file. By doing this, he hopes to demonstrate the underlying workings of ChatGPT. For the Transformer neural network to predict the next character in a sequence, it will look at the preceding characters as context. Once trained, the system will be able to generate sequences of text that resemble Shakespeare's style.
