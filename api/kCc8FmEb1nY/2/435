This passage is about using artificial intelligence to generate text that mimics the style of William Shakespeare. By inputting all of Shakespeare's works into an AI system (in this case, a model called a Transformer), the AI can analyze patterns and predict what character might come next given a set of characters. It can apply this knowledge to generate text that seems to have been written by Shakespeare. The author discusses using this same process for any dataset, meaning this system could be adapted to mimic the style of any text.
