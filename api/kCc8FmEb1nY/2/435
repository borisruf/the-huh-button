The speaker is explaining how the AI system ChatGPT works. The system can generate different responses to a given text task. For example, when asked to write a haiku about the importance of understanding AI, the AI system can generate multiple different responses. The speaker explains that this is because ChatGPT is a "probabilistic system," which means it can generate multiple outcomes from the same input.

The system works by using something called a language model, which has learned how words follow each other in the English language. These language models use a Neural Network called the Transformer, which came from a landmark AI paper in 2017. The Transformer forms the core of the language model used by ChatGPT.

The speaker then moves to the practical part where he wants to replicate ChatGPT but in a simplified manner. He proposes using a dataset called Tiny Shakespeare, which includes all the works of Shakespeare. He will train the Transformer to predict what character is likely to come next in a sequence of characters from Shakespeare's works. The aim is not to reproduce the same complexity as ChatGPT, but to give an understanding of how these systems work.

For those who are interested in in-depth understanding, the speaker has shared the code used in this study on GitHub. But to understand it, you need a good command of Python, alongside some understanding of calculus and statistics. It's also helpful to watch the speaker's earlier videos which go into more detail about smaller, simpler neural network language models.
