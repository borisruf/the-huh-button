The speaker is explaining the process of how an artificial intelligence system, like ChatGPT, is able to generate unique responses to different prompts. He describes the dataset that will be used to train a Transformer-based language model, known as 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all of Shakespeare's works. A language model is created using a neural network, and by training this model on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, the model will learn to produce sequences of text that emulate the style and language of Shakespeare. 

The speaker has already written code that trains these Transformers, and he plans to walk participants through it, with the ultimate goal being that participants will understand and appreciate how Chat GPT works. He also explains how to convert raw text to integers, a process termed "tokenizing", using different methods such as character-level or sub-word level encoding. 

The speaker then proceeds to tokenize the entire Shakespeare text and turn it into a tensor, which allows for efficient computational operations. The first 1000 elements of this tensor are then displayed.
