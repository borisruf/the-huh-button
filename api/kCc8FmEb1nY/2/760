The person is looking at a large amount of text data, known as the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. They are using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) program to analyze the data and predict the next character in a sequence. They are referencing a previous attempt where they created a language model to predict sequences of characters. The AI is essentially trying to 'learn' the patterns in Shakespeare's writing and generate new text that looks similar. They are explaining how they are going to replicate this process with an empty file and build up the language model again, step by step. They will then test the model by having it generate new text based on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset.
