This description is about what goes on behind the scenes of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model. The speaker is breaking down how it works, how they trained it to understand language, and what kind of tasks it can handle. In this case, they taught it to generate language like Shakespeare by feeding it all of Shakespeare's works and then asking it to predict the next character based on previous ones. They also clarify that the AI doesn't understand words as we do but rather sees them as a sequence of characters. To illustrate this, the speaker mentions the 65 different characters used in the training data, including space, special characters, and both uppercase and lowercase letters.
