Andrej mentions that he will instruct the audience on how to construct a language model using a Transformer Neural Network, a technology derived from an academic text titled "Attention is All You Need". He elaborates that instead of using an extensive internet database, they will use a smaller, simpler 'toy' database called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which is a compilation of all Shakespeare's works. With this database, the network will be trained to predict the sequence of characters, thus learning language patterns within the data. The aim is to generate infinite, plausible Shakespearian-like text. The training code is available online in a GitHub repository named 'Nano GPT'. By the end, the viewers would understand the mechanism behind Chat GPT. Andrej further clarifies that basic knowledge in Python, calculus, and statistics is helpful to follow along.
