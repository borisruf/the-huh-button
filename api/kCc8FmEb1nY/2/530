The speaker is preparing to demonstrate a series of coding steps. They have opened an input file, in this case the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data set. This means they are accessing the data stored in the file, which is a series of works by Shakespeare. The code will be used to train a language model, with the goal for the software to generate text similar to that of Shakespeare.
