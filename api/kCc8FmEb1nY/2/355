ChatGPT is like when you start a pattern, and it finishes it for you. So, if you use words to begin a pattern or sequence, like starting to agree a haiku or story, ChatGPT will finish it for you in a way that makes sense. Different times you try, you might get different endings to your pattern. Itâ€™s like it knows how to carry on the pattern using English words or phrases.
