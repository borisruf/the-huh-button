The speaker is talking about how they have written code to train a type of AI models called Transformers. These Transformers are used in language modeling systems, like ChatGPT, to predict and generate logical sequences of words based on given inputs. The speaker has written a more simplified version of this system which operates at a character level, using data from the works of Shakespeare. They have coded this system to predict what character might come next in a sequence. The code has been shared on GitHub, a platform where developers share their code, under a repository named Nano GPT.
