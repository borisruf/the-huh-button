The speaker is explaining about a program they have created using an AI model. This model was trained to generate text like William Shakespeare by learning patterns in Shakespeare's works. This model works by predicting what character is likely to come next in a sentence, given the previous characters. 

For example, let's say we input the string "Wher" into the model. Based on how it has been trained, it might predict the next character in the sequence is "e" because in Shakespeare's works, the character sequence "Wher" is often followed by an 'e', as in "Where". 

To do this, the program converts each character in the data set it is trained on - in this case, Shakespeare's works - into integers, or numbers. The set of all characters it recognizes is called the vocabulary. The program then uses these numbers to make its predictions and generate new text. So, the process of changing characters into numbers is called 'encoding', and changing the numbers back into characters is 'decoding'. The program has created a lookup table to do this encoding and decoding more efficiently.
