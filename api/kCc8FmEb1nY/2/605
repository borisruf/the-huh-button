In this transcript, Andrej discusses a system called ChatGPT. It is a language model that generates words or phrases based on input provided. Andrej explains that it generates different outcomes for the same prompts due to its probabilistic nature. He then shifts focus to the technology behind ChatGPT - a type of neural network architecture called 'Transformer.' This system was first presented in a research paper "Attention is All You Need" in 2017. Since then, with minor alterations, this architecture has been adopted across the field of AI for various applications, and it is the core of ChatGPT. To demonstrate how these systems work, he proposes to build a simpler language model based on the Transformer network using a set of data called 'Tiny Shakespeare,' a combination of all the works of Shakespeare. The aim is to train the computer to predict the sequence of characters in a text, thereby producing language that resembles Shakespeare's text. He plans to write and train this model from scratch.
