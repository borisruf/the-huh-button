In this context, the speaker is explaining that they have started to write code in a Google Colaboratory (Colab) notebook (an online platform for coding) in order to train an AI 'language model' using a popular neural network architecture known as the Transformer. They explain that, to train this model, they are using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. It contains all of the works of Shakespeare, condensed into a single text file that's about one megabyte in size. The goal is for the AI to learn the patterns of words in this text, so that it can then generate text that's similar to Shakespeare's writings. The speaker says "Here, I open the "input" as they start to write the code that will open the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset (which is their input data) in their Google Colab notebook.
