In his speech, Andrej explains how an AI system called ChatGPT works. According to him, it can write text based on prompts, giving slightly different answers each time. Andrej also explains that the underlying architecture of ChatGPT, called Transformer, was originally created for machine translation. The system is trained on huge amounts of internet data and uses complex stages of pre-training and fine-tuning. Andrej shares that though they can't recreate the same system, he wants to help viewers understand the internal workings of such an AI model. He uses a simpler language model based on Transformer, trained on a small dataset from Shakespeare. The system will predict the next character in a sequence based on previous sequences. He shares that he has written and shared code for this training on GitHub, which can be used on any text data. For this demonstration, Andrej uses a Google Colab Jupyter notebook and the code can be found in the video description.
