Opening the "input" refers to instructing the coding environment to specifically access and utilize a dataset named 'input'. This can involve reading a file, processing the data, or feeding the data to a particular function or program such as an AI model. The 'input' could be any form of data, such as text or numbers, which the program can work with.
