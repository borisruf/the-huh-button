Andrej is explaining that he's going to show us how to build a language model based on the Transformer neural network that's used in ChatGPT, an AI that generates responses to text-based tasks. To keep things simple, he's going to use a small data set, called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all of Shakespeare's works in one file. He plans to train the model to predict the next character in a given sequence of characters from the dataset. Once the system is trained, it'll be able to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing. This model will operate in a similar way to ChatGPT, going through text character by character.
