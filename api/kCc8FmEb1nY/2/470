This speaker is discussing a type of artificial intelligence (AI) known as a 'language model'. Language models, like ChatGPT, are trained to complete sequences of words in a way that mirrors human language. They are able to generate different responses to the same prompt, depending on various factors. Under the hood of these models is a concept called the 'Transformer', which was proposed in a 2017 paper. The speaker is going to train a simplified, character-level language model using Shakespeare's works as a data set. Using the completed model, it will be possible to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing. The speaker has already outlined this process in a project named 'Nano GPT', which can be found on their GitHub account. However, they are going to recreate this project from scratch in the video, to help viewers understand how it all works. Knowledge of Python, basic calculus and statistics would be helpful for understanding the content of the video. The speaker also recommends their previous videos where they defined simpler language models.
