Andrej is explaining that he plans to create a simpler version of the ChatGPT AI language model using a smaller dataset, namely the writings of Shakespeare. He wants to demonstrate how the AI can learn from the text and generate its own Shakespeare-like prose. Andrej states he will create a Transformer neural network, a type of AI model, that can predict the likely next character in a sequence from the plays. Despite not being as complex as the original ChatGPT, he expects this simplified model to help viewers understand how the system operates under the hood, and all they need is some proficiency in Python and basic understanding of calculus and statistics. Finally, he's prepared a code, which he will share via a Google Colab Jupyter notebook, allowing others to follow along with the project.
