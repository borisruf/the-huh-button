This part of the text explains the tasks of a tokenizer. A tokenizer is a tool in natural language processing (NLP) that converts text into a list of units called tokens. In this particular explanation, the tokenizer being used is operating at a character-level, which means it breaks down the text into separate characters.

The example given was the text 'hi, there', which the tokenizer broke down into a list of integers that represent each character of the input text. This process is also reversible â€“ the list of integers could be translated back into the original text.

A different method of tokenizing mentioned here is a 'sentence piece' tokenizer, commonly used by Google, which breaks down the text into 'sub-words' or keywords. For instance, the words 'football', 'foot' and 'ball' might be tokenized differently, so that each integer represents a more significant piece of the text instead of a single character.
