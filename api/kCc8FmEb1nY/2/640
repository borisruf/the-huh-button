Andrej is explaining how various artificial intelligence (AI) applications, like Chat GPT, work. Chat GPT is a language model that creates sequences of words and can be used to respond to various prompts. Andrej uses the example of a prompt like "write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree" to show how Chat GPT can generate an appropriate and somewhat humorous response. He further explains that this ability comes from a machine learning architecture known as a Transformer, which was introduced in a 2017 paper. Andrej will explore how this architecture works by building a simplified version of it using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data set and showing how it can generate text that sounds like Shakespeare.
