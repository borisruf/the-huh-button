Opening the "input" refers to accessing a file or dataset that the programming code will use. In this context, the speaker is likely about to open a file named 'input' that contains the dataset (Tiny Shakespeare) they plan to use to train the 'Transformer' language model they are building. The term "open" is commonly used in programming to indicate when a file is being accessed or used.
