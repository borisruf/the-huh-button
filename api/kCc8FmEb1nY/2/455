ChatGPT is a computer program that can make sentences. If I start a sentence, it can finish it for me. It uses patterns it learned from many other sentences to make the end of my sentence. For example, if I say "I want to go to the...", it might finish the sentence by saying "beach." If I ask it again, it might say "store." The end of the sentence can be different each time.
