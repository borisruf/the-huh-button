This is quite a long text, so it seems you are looking for a brief summary. The speaker is discussing an artificial intelligence system called ChatGPT, which generates text in a conversation-like manner. The AI uses a language model to understand how words follow each other. This language model uses a Transformers architecture, which is based on a landmark paper in AI called "Attention is All You Need". The speaker is intending to train a Transformer-based language model in a step-by-step manner using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which is a compilation of all Shakespeare works. As the AI is trained, it will learn to predict subsequent characters after a given sequence of characters, essentially reproducing similar text to that of Shakespeare. The speaker notes that this lecture is meant to help viewers understand how the ChatGPT system works 'under the hood'. Previous knowledge of Python, calculus, and statistics, as well as watching the speaker's past lectures, will be beneficial for understanding the content. All the developed code will be shared later on in the video description.
