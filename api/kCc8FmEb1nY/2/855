Andrej is explaining what Chat GPT is and how it works. He explains that it is an AI system capable of generating varied responses to particular prompts because it is probabilistic. He also mentions that ChatGPT is a language model that predicts sequences of words based on what it has been given at the start. He goes on to discuss the 'Transformer' network that is the foundation for how ChatGPT works. He proposes to demonstrate how this system works using a simpler model and a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which contains all of Shakespeare's works. Lastly, he explains that he has already written some code that people can access to further understand this concept. He plans to explain and recreate this code with the intention of helping listeners better comprehend how this AI model works.
