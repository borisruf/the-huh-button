The speaker is describing the process in which he is using the computer programming language known as Python in a Google Colab notebook to train an artificial intelligence model called a transformer. This is using a toy dataset composed of all the works by the playwright Shakespeare, commonly referred to as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. 

The process involves making the transformer predict the next character in a sequence, given a context of characters. After sufficient training, the transformer can generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing. 

"Here, I open the input" likely refers to the speaker initiating the process by feeding the Tiny Shakespeare data into the transformer.
