Andrej is explaining that he will be demonstrating how to build an AI language model using a simpler Transformer network. For his example, he will use a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which includes all the works of Shakespeare. The goal of his demonstration is to predict the sequence of characters in the Shakespeare's works, and thus generate an infinite amount of Shakespeare-like language. Andrej noted that this method of producing AI-generated writing mirrors that of ChatGPT, which uses a more complicated Transformer-based system. Andrej has already written the code to train these Transformers, which can be found in his GitHub repository named 'nano GPT'.
