Sure! This is discussing how words or sequences of words (referred to as 'tokens') in an AI system can be represented and identified. For instance, when training an AI model like ChatGPT, each word or phrase must be given a unique identification (like a number or code); this process is referred to as 'tokenization' or 'encoding'. Here, a simple form of encoding is explained where each character is assigned a unique number. But this is just one example - there are many different ways to do this, and different companies or researchers may use different methods. For example, Google uses a tokenization method called 'sentence piece'.
