The speaker is discussing ChatGPT, a powerful AI language model developed by OpenAI. It generates coherent and contextually relevant sentences by predicting the next word in a given sequence of words. After feeding in a prompt, ChatGPT extends the sequence to create a detailed response. The underpinning technology is called the Transformer architecture; a method for handling sequential data inputs like text.

For demonstration purposes, the speaker wants to create a simpler version of ChatGPT using Python. Instead of using all of the internetâ€™s text as the AI's training data, the speaker opts for 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This smaller dataset consists of all Shakespeare's works. The AI will learn how characters follow one another in the dataset and then generate more Shakespeare-like text.

'Encoding' or 'tokenization' refers to the conversion of raw text into a sequence of integers. Each integer represents a character or word, depending on the type of encoding. Here, the speaker uses a character-based approach, where each character in the Shakespeare dataset is represented by a specific integer. Other types of encoding, like word- or sub-word-level encoding, are also available. They are implemented based on the requirements of the task and the complexity of the language model. 

For example, GPT-2 uses a type of encoding called Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), facilitated by a library called 'Tick Token'. Unlike character-level encoding, BPE allows the AI to break words into frequently recurring smaller parts or 'subwords'. This approach ensures better representation of the data and handles the problem of out-of-vocabulary words more adeptly.
