To put it simpler, the speaker is stating the process of working with an Artificial Intelligence language model called GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). This system can generate text based on the input or prompt given to it, and it can produce different results each time, even with the same prompt. The speaker is about to demonstrate how GPT works by using a file that contains all of Shakespeare's works, and aim to predict the next character in a sequence. To achieve this, they will define a Transformer from scratch and train it on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data. Emphasis is made on explaining how GPT works internally. The speaker is using a Google Colab notebook to share the code they are developing. Finally, the speaker is opening the 'Input'.
