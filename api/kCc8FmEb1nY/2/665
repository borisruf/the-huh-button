In his speech, Andrej is explaining the similarities and differences between ChatGPT and what he's preparing to create using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He shares that ChatGPT is a sophisticated, professionally developed AI that can generate human-like responses to written input by predicting the following words in given sequences. He plans to do something akin, but rather than using a database as vast as the internet, he's opting for a compilation of Shakespeare's works, aiming to teach a Transformer neural network to predict sequences in Shakespearean style. Andrej clarifies that though the processes used for ChatGPT and his project are similar, ChatGPT parses data in 'token' form, which are smaller chunks, while his project focuses on individual characters. He also states that he has already written all the necessary codes for the model and shared them on his GitHub page.
