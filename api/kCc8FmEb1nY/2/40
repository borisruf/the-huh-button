ChatGPT is a computer program that can write text based on what you ask it to do. For example, you could ask it to create a small poem about the benefits of understanding artificial intelligence. In this example, I asked it to do so and it created the phrase, "knowledge brings prosperity for all to see. Embrace its power." It generates these words one after the other, from left to right. When I asked it the same request again, it gave me a slightly different response. This shows that the program can create unique responses to the same prompt.
