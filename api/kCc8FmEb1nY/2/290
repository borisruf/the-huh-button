ChatGPT is an AI system that predicts and generates sequences of words. It works like how children learn to speak: the AI takes a string of words (the input or 'prompt'), and predicts what word is likely to come next. This is why a single prompt can generate slightly different responses: given the same words to start with, there are many possible ways to continue. Right now, the speaker is discussing the goal of teaching an AI known as a 'Transformer' to mimic the style of the famous playwright, Shakespeare. The AI is given a piece of text from Shakespeare's works, then predicts what comes next character by character, eventually generating text that resembles Shakespeare's writing. However, some mistakes are present which the speaker cannot correct. Despite this, the resulting output is mostly 'Shakespearean'.
