This is discussing the creation and use of an AI language model. By inputting a prompt, this model will generate text based upon that input. The model was created using a Transformer architecture, a method of machine learning made popular by a 2017 paper. For the purpose of this explanation, the model is trained using the complete works of Shakespeare, generating its outputs based on those works. The end result is that given a string of characters, the model will predict which character 'naturally' comes next, thus generating a line of 'Shakespearean' text. It's stressed that you don't need to have mastered any complex programming languages to understand how to create this model, just a knowledge of Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics.
