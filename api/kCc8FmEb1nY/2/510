The phrase you mentioned is about getting all unique characters used in a text, listing them, and then arranging them in a certain (adjustable) order. Here is a breakdown for you:

1. "When I call the set constructor on it, I'm just going to get the set of all the characters that occur in this text." - This means that we are creating a set from our text. In Python, a set is like a list, but it only keeps unique values, so any repeated characters are removed.

2. "And then I call 'list' on that to create a list of those characters instead of just a set" - This means that we are now converting the set back into a list. We do this because we want to be able to sort the characters, and you can't sort a set.

3.  "so that I have an ordering - an arbitrary ordering - and then I sort that" - Here we caused our list to be sorted. Doing this puts all the characters in the text into a recognizable order, making it easier for us to work with them later.
