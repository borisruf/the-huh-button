Andrej is explaining that ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, can generate text based on prompts provided by users. When Andrej gives a starting sequence (or 'prompt'), the system creates an ending sequence or outcome. In other words, he gives it a task in the form of a sentence, and the system completes or adds on to that initial sentence in a way that makes logical sense in English.
