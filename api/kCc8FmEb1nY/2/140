ChatGPT is a type of artificial intelligence that can create text. If you give it the beginning of a sentence or phrase, it will finish the rest of it. For example, if you start with "Today is...", it might finish with "...a beautiful day." What it comes up with can be different each time you give it the same start, which makes it interesting and fun to use. This is because it is designed to understand and follow the patterns of how words are used together in English.
