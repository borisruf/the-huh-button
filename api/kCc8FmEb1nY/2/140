The passage talks about ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can generate and complete sentences, paragraphs or even write a full creative text based on the writing task or prompt you provide it with. The outcome is not always the same even if you repeat the same task because the model generates different possible answers each time. 

The system functions as a language model, where it predicts what word should come next based on the sequence of words it has been given. The concept of ChatGPT comes from a significant scientific research paper called "Attention is All You Need", which introduced the 'Transformer' architecture in the AI field. This architecture helps in better understanding the sequence of words. In this case, GPT is short for 'generatively pre-trained Transformer', which means that the model has been pre-trained to understand and generate language in a particular manner.
