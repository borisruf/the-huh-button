This speaker is telling us how the ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) system works and how we can develop a simple AI model just like it. The speaker explains that the AI can generate different responses for the same task. For example, in the case of writing a haiku, it can give different versions. This AI system was established from the concepts of a research paper titled "Attention is All You Need". The speaker also explains that the AI is a 'language model' that can predict the sequence of words based on the given start sequence. 

The speaker's main aim is to guide us in creating a Transformer-based language model similar to ChatGPT. We will use the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset for training. This data set contains all the works of Shakespeare, from which the model will learn to generate sequences that resemble Shakespeare's style of writing. The model will predict the next character in a sequence based on previous characters.

Finally, the speaker assures us that the whole process won't be complex. We only need good Python skills and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics to follow along. They also recommend watching their previous videos on the same topic.
