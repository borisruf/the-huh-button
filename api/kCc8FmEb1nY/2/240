Andrej is explaining that ChatGPT, a type of artificial intelligence, operates by modeling the sequence of words in a language. He starts a particular sequence or 'prompt', and the system will continue to construct the sequence based on its programming and understanding of how words follow one another in English. It's like giving a beginning to a story, and the AI will come up with its own ending. However, each time the system may generate different endings for the same beginning, due to its 'probabilistic' nature, which essentially means it can provide various possible answers.
