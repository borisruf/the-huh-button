This comment is about how an AI called ChatGPT uses a type of algorithm, the Transformer, to generate text responses in the English language. Each response is a bit different but always makes sense. The algorithm learns how to sequentially put words together from large amounts of data. It then uses this information to complete any text sentence it is given in a probable and logical manner, making the conversation interesting and dynamic. 

For example, the speaker shares humorous instructions given to the AI, like writing a dramatic news report about a leaf falling. More seriously, the speaker proposes to simplify the process, turning away from the vast expanse of the internet and focusing on training the algorithm using a more manageable dataset. In this case, they suggest using the full works of Shakespeare, 'Tiny Shakespeare', as a learning tool.
