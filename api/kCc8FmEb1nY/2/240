The AI, ChatGPT, is like a really clever game player. Imagine you started a game where you say the first part of a sentence, such as 'Once upon a time there was...' and then the AI has to finish the story for you. Whatever starting point you give, the AI takes the ball and runs with it, creating a unique ending or continuation each time. It's like a digital friend helping you complete your sentences or stories.
