The speaker is introducing the capability of ChatGPT, an AI system, that can generate different responses based on varied text-based prompts. The system is described as a language model as it predicts and generates sequences of words, resembling a complete and meaningful phrase or sentence. The speaker then presents the main technology behind this system, called the Transformer, an AI model described in a significant 2017 paper titled "Attention is all you need". The speaker then proposes to illustrate how this system works by building a simplified version using the Transformer model and a smaller dataset for training. The dataset the speaker suggests is called Tiny Shakespeare, which is essentially a combination of all of Shakespeare's works.
