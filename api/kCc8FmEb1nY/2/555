This is a detailed discussion on how to create a language model, specifically a character-level language model, using the Transformer architecture from the 2017 "Attention is All You Need" paper, based on GPT (Generatively Pretrained Transformer). The model is to be trained on a small dataset known as Tiny Shakespeare, which contains all the works of Shakespeare. The idea is to train the model to predict the next character in a sequence based on the preceding characters. This is similar to how ChatGPT works, but on a smaller scale. The character-level language model could generate text in the style of Shakespeare. The training and implementation of the model is done in Python, and makes use of the Transformer architecture to predict the next character in a sequence. The vocabulary for this model consists of all unique characters that occur in the text. The raw text data is converted to a sequence of integers, each integer representing a unique character in the text. This process is called tokenization.
