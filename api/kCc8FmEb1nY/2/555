This section of the text is talking about pre-processing text for language models, specifically a model that is being trained on the works of Shakespeare. Every unique character in the text is identified and ordered, making a list of 65 distinct characters. This list becomes the "vocabulary" for the model â€“ the collection of all possible elements it might put into the sequences it generates. The purpose of doing this is to convert the characters, which the model can't work with directly, into a numerical format it can process.
