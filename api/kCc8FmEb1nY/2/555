In his presentation, Andrej talks about a system named ChatGPT, which, using an artificial neural network called Transformer, can generate different text outputs based on a given prompt. He illustrates this system using examples of prompts and the varying responses generated by the AI. Andrej then states that while he cannot completely replicate the ChatGPT system (as it's a complex, industry-grade system that has been trained on a large volume of internet data), he intends to train a simpler version of a Transformer-based language model using a smaller text dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This dataset comprises all of Shakespeare's works condensed into a single file. He shows an example of how once the AI system is trained on this data, it can generate text that mimics the language and style of Shakespeare. He also mentions a GitHub repository where he has written code to train these Transformers, which he aims to simplify and recreate in this lecture. Andrej hopes his tutorial can help viewers better understand how ChatGPT operates 'under the hood'.
