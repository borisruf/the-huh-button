ChatGPT is a computer program that can generate text. It can process a simple instruction, such as "write a haiku about AI". When I give it an instruction like this, it treats it like the start of a chain of words. Then, it continues this chain with words that make sense according to what it has previously learned. This leads to an end result that completes my original instruction.
