ChatGPT is a type of AI that completes sequences of text based on a prompt given to it. Like if you start a sentence or thought, it will finish it for you. It can come up with multiple different responses to the same prompt. The AI is well-versed in how words are commonly used together in English, and uses that knowledge to complete the sequences.
