This part of the tutorial is dealing with the encoding process of text data when preparing an AI model for the task of language prediction. We start off with all the works of Shakespeare, read into the model as a simple string of text. This text is full of individual characters or 'tokens', which the model will need to recognize and predict.

To make this more manageable, the text is then converted or 'tokenized' into a sequence of integers. The particular method used here is a character-level tokenizer, which essentially treats every character (including spaces and punctuation) as a distinct token. These tokens are then converted into a corresponding integer. This sequence of integers effectively becomes the AI model's 'vocabulary', a frame of reference it will use to understand and analyze the text.

So basically, in this part of the tutorial, they are making a kind of dictionary. Each word or token in the text corresponds to an integer, and these pairings are stored in a look-up table. This allows the AI model to translate back and forth between the raw text and the simplified sequence of integers. This step is important for preparing text data for language prediction tasks, which involves training the AI model to recognize the patterns within the text and predict what comes next.
