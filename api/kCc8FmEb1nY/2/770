Andrej is explaining how he will illustrate the workings of a powerful AI language model, similar to a one known as ChatGPT, using a simplified dataset. He plans on creating the model from scratch in a user-friendly format. His aim is for the audience to understand how such a system operates. He's using a collection of Shakespeare's works as the dataset and will teach this model to predict the next character in a sequence based on the previously given character context. By using a simple implementation and focusing on the character-level language model, he will train the neural network to mimic Shakespeare's language but will not be able to completely reproduce ChatGPT due to its complex nature.
