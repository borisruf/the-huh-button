The individual was explaining a large-scale language model and character generation system, similar to ChatGPT. They were discussing how they were going to build and train a Transformer-based model on a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This model would learn to predict the next character based on previous characters in the text. They mentioned that the number of unique characters in the text would represent the size of the character vocabulary, which turned out to be 65. These 65 characters are the potential elements that could be included in the sequences generated by the model. The individual highlighted this figure as it indicates the variety of characters the model will need to understand and generate.
