In the video, Andrej speaks about a language model known as a 'Transformer' that forms the core of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system called GPT, or 'generatively pre-trained Transformer'. He explains that this model was first introduced in a 2017 paper and has since been used in many AI applications, including ChatGPT. Andrej also mentions that he is unable to replicate the scale of the ChatGPT system, so instead, he plans to create a smaller version using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He describes his goal as helping the audience understand how ChatGPT works and notes that his tutorial will require some knowledge of Python, calculus, and statistics.
