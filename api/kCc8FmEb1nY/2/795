The process of splitting the data set into a train set and a validation set is as follows:

- The train set is where the model learns from. It "trains" on this set by adjusting its weights and parameters to accurately predict the outcomes.
- The validation set, on the other hand, is used to evaluate how well the model has learned from the training set. It is used to fine-tune the model and to make sure it is not overfitting to the train set.

So, before moving further, it is necessary to split the data set into these two parts - training and validation.
