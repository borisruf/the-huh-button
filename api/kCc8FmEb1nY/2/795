The speaker, Andrej, explains that the Artificial Intelligence technology ChatGPT can generate different texts in response to a prompt, and those texts can have slight variations. He mentions that ChatGPT, a language model, can predict what comes next in a sequence of words based on its training on a large body of text data. Then, he proposes creating a similar system using a smaller dataset compiled from William Shakespeare's works, intending to show how ChatGPT functions. Andrej asserts that by training this smaller "language model" on the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset, the system can generate text that imitates Shakespeare's writing style.
