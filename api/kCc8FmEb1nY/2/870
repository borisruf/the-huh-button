In the video, Andrej is planning to build a smaller and simpler version of a tool similar to ChatGPT using a data set called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He explains that this will involve using a Transformer-based language model to predict the next character in a sequence from Shakespeare's works. Once the system is trained, it can generate its own text which looks like it was written by Shakespeare. Andrej suggests that this example of creating a language model using a Transformer can help viewers understand how ChatGPT, a more complex AI model, works.
