This text is about training an AI model using a language model based on Shakespeare's work. "Tiny Shakespeare" compiles all of Shakespeare's works into a single file, and is used as a training dataset for the model. The AI, using PyTorch, can predict what character or word comes next based on what it has learned from the training dataset, effectively imitating Shakespeare's writing style.
