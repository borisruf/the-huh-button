The speaker, Andrej, is discussing his plan to create a simple version of the complex AI system, ChatGPT. He intends to use a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare', composed of all of Shakespeare's works, to train a Transformer neural network. This will help him demonstrate how the ChatGPT system operates. The system is predicted to produce content similar to Shakespeare's writing through understanding patterns observed in the data. He has also prepared code in a Github repository called 'nano GPT', which can be used as a simple introduction to training Transformers on any text dataset. Throughout this project, Andrej's goal is to help his audience understand the underlying mechanism of the ChatGPT system.
