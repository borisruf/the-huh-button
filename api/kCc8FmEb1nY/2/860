Andrej explains that he will show how to build and train a simple version of a Transformer-based language model using a small dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which includes all of the works of Shakespeare. He mentions that the model will predict the next character in a sequence from this dataset, learning patterns and mimicking the language of Shakespeare. He emphasizes that this process is very similar to how ChatGPT works, noting the only difference is that ChatGPT predicts 'tokens' or parts of words rather than individual characters. Moreover, Andrej points out that he has already written code for this project and it is available in a GitHub repository named 'Nano GPT'. He plans to rewrite this code from scratch in the educational video to demonstrate how it works.
