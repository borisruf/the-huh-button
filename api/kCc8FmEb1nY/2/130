ChatGPT uses a type of neural network called a "transformer". This is a complex algorithm that analyses and predicts sequences of words. Just like the human brain learns from experiences, a neural network learns from a lot of data. In the case of ChatGPT, it learns from billions of sentences from the internet. The network looks at each word and its relationship with the words around it. By doing this over and over again, it can start to recognize patterns and predict what words should come next in a sequence. That's how it can write poems, answer questions or come up with fun responses to unusual prompts.
