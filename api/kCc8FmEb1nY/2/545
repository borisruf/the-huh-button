In the given text, the author is going to use a specific data set, called 'Tiny Shakespeare', to train a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) system known as a Transformer. The AI is trained to model or predict the sequence of characters in Shakespeare's works. After the training, this AI should be able to generate text that resembles the language used by Shakespeare. This whole process is a simplified example to help us understand how a more complex AI system, like ChatGPT, works.
