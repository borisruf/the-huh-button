Andrej is explaining that he plans to construct a smaller, simplified version of Chat GPT. He will focus on training it on a small set of data, 'Tiny Shakespeare', which is made up of Shakespeare's works. The AI will learn patterns and sequences from this data and apply it in generating text. The purpose of this exercise is to help viewers understand the complex workings of Chat GPT in a simpler setting, using the techniques from his previous videos. The final code will be available on Google's shared coding platform, Colab, and the notebook will be linked in the video description for viewers to access and explore on their own.
