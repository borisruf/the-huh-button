In this context, the person is explaining language models and how they generate text based on given prompts. They particularly mention ChatGPT, which is a powerful and complex model generated by OpenAI. They also discuss the Transformer, a type of artificial intelligence model used in many language processing tasks, including ChatGPT.

The person suggests that while they can't replicate ChatGPT completely due to its complexity, they can create a simpler version using a subset of this technology: the Transformer. To do so, they use the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which includes all of Shakespeare's words, as training data.

Once the training is done, the model can generate language that mimics the style of Shakespeare. The person created a repository in GitHub called "Nano GPT" where they have written code that trains Transformers on any given text input. This repository allows others to create their own language models in a simpler and more digestible way.
