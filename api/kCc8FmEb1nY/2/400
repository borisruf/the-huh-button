The speaker is introducing a language model called ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI. This AI system can generate text based on a prompt provided by a user. The speaker explains that even though the output can change slightly each time, it is still very effective in producing coherent language for various tasks. 

The underlying technology of ChatGPT is based on a neural network known as Transformer, which was proposed in a 2017 research paper. This model captures the sequence of words in language, making it possible for AI to predict what word will likely follow a sequence of words.

The speaker then describes how he attempted to replicate a version of ChatGPT using a smaller dataset. For this, he uses a document consisting of all of Shakespeareâ€™s works, and trains a Transformer model to predict what character (letter) is likely to come next given a chunk of characters from this document. The aim is to create a model that generates text in the style of Shakespeare. 

He clarifies that this setup isn't as complex or as powerful as ChatGPT, but it's a good way to understand how these systems work. The speaker has created a repository called Nano GPT on Github, where he has provided the code for his experiment.

Lastly, he mentions that if the model is trained on a larger data set of web pages known as Open Webtext, it manages to reproduce the performance of GPT2, an early version of OpenAI's GPT from 2017.
