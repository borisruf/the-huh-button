The phrase "Here, I open the 'input" refers to opening a file in a code. In this context, the speaker is about to open the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset which is a file that has been downloaded. This is often done using a programming language, such as Python, to read the data from the file for further processing or analysis. This could include training an AI model, as the speaker is doing in this context.
