Andrej explains that in this video, he will be demonstrating how to build a simplified version of the technology that powers ChatGPT, a text-based AI system. He will focus on creating a 'transformer-based language model', a type of AI model that is trained to predict the sequence of words. This version is based on a collection of works by Shakespeare called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. Andrej's purpose is to show how this underlying technology works in a way that is understandable to those with a basic knowledge of Python, calculus and statistics.
