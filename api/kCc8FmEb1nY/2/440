Andrej is explaining that ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, is like a 'language model'. What it does is it learns and understands how words follow each other in a sequence in the English language. If he gives it the start of a phrase or sentence (called a sequence), the system will complete that sequence by generating an outcome. The outcome can vary each time, as it's a system that can produce multiple responses to the same initial prompt.
