The speaker is a programmer who is explaining how to build and train a simplified version of a Transformer neural network model, similar to the one used by OpenAI's ChatGPT. They will be using a dataset called "Tiny Shakespeare", which comprises all the works of William Shakespeare. This model will be trained to predict the sequence of characters in the text similar to how ChatGPT predicts word sequences. They have previously created a series, "Make More", where they explain simpler neural network models. In this specific video, they will be focusing on the complex Transformer neural network model.
