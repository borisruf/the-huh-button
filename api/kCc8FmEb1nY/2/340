I have created a simplified version of a programming code that trains AI based on a model called Transformers. This code only deals with characters, not words or phrases. The training data I used is a compilation of all works of Shakespeare. After it's trained, the AI can generate text that sounds like Shakespeare. This code can be found on a platform called Github, under the name "nano GPT".
