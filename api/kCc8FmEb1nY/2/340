ChatGPT is a type of artificial intelligence that can generate text based on the words or phrases it's given to start with. Essentially, you give it the beginning of a sentence, a story, or a prompt, and it completes the rest of the text. This is like if you start a game of dominoes and it finishes setting up the rest of the pieces based on the one you started with.
