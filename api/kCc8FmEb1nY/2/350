ChatGPT is like a computer program that knows how words are arranged in English. When I provide it the beginning part of a sentence or story, it can guess what comes next and write the rest of it. This is called completing a sequence. The interesting part is that it can give different endings for the same beginning part, which makes its responses a bit unpredictable.
