The speaker explains that ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) system, functions as a 'language model.' This means it learns and understands the pattern of how words follow each other in the English language. He mentions that when one provides the AI with the beginning of a sentence or phrase, also known as a 'sequence', ChatGPT completes it. It uses its knowledge learned from previous examples to generate the remaining part of the sequence.
