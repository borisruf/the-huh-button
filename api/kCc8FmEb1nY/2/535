In this long passage, the speaker is explaining how an artificial intelligence system called ChatGPT works, using easy-to-understand examples and scenarios. He describes how this AI, which is trained on a huge amount of data from the internet, can generate a variety of responses based on a given input. He also tells us how the system can be tested with various amusing requests and tasks. 

The speaker then moves on to discuss the artificial intelligence model underlying ChatGPT, and the work it does to generate its output. They focus on 'Transformers', a type of neural network model used in AI that was proposed in a groundbreaking paper back in 2017. Afterward, he presents his intention to simulate something similar to ChatGPT using a smaller dataset, specifically the entire works of Shakespeare in a single file. 

The speaker then demonstrates how this AI works by predicting the sequence of characters in Shakespeare's works and can even create infinite, Shakespeare-looking texts. They further discuss another project they've been working on, called 'Nano GPT', which is a similar system to what was just described, but in a smaller, simpler scale. 

To wrap up, the speaker announces their plan of showing how to build this AI step by step in Python. They emphasize that some basic understanding of Python, calculus, and statistics are necessary to understand how it all works, as well as a preliminary understanding of language modeling and AI. 

In a nutshell, this extract is a comprehensive overview on how AI neural networks, specifically transformers, can be created and used to generate text, using Python.
