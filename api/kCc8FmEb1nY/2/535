The story is about how an AI model called ChatGPT functions precisely. It explains that the AI model operates on a character-level language model, and it's like a 'language model' because it calculates and predicts the sequence of words. The AI is given the start of a sentence, and it completes the rest of the sentence. 

This AI works with a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. It maintains and learns patterns from the Shakespeare data. So when a sentence or group of characters is inputted, the AI predicts the next character sequence based on Shakespeare's writing patterns. So, basically, it can produce text that somewhat resembles Shakespeare.

The characters in the dataset, from which the AI learns patterns, are called the vocabulary. There is a total of 65 characters in the vocabulary, including a space character, various special characters, and all uppercase and lowercase English letters. The vocabulary encapsulates all the possible characters that the model can see and predict.
