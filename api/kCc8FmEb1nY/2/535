Andrej is explaining how to build a smaller version of an artificial intelligence system called ChatGPT using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He'll use this to demonstrate how ChatGPT works under the hood. The dataset contains all of Shakespeare's works, and Andrej's system will analyze the patterns and structures to predict the next character in any given sequence. This way, he can generate language that looks like it was written by Shakespeare. He emphasizes that they are not trying to recreate ChatGPT exactly due to its complexity, but rather provide a simpler, educational example using a Transformer-based language model.
