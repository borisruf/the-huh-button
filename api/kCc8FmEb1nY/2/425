This person is giving a lecture about the chatbot, ChatGPT, and how it works. They explain that it uses a method called the Transformer which can generate different results for the same prompt. The goal of this lecture is to build something similar to a ChatGPT by writing the Transformer model from scratch. To accomplish this, instead of using the whole internet as training data like ChatGPT does, they are going to use a smaller dataset called Tiny Shakespeare. After the Transformer is trained with this data, it will be able to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's works, character by character. They have already written a version of this program on GitHub called Nano GPT.
