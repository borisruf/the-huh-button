ChatGPT is a language model created by OpenAI that generates text based on the input it receives. It works by predicting the next word or token in a sequence of words. If you ask it to write a poem or a news article, it gives you an output that is reasonable from the perspective of human language. It's based on a machine learning structure known as the Transformer, created as a result of a research paper called "Attention is all you need" published in 2017.

ChatGPT has the ability to generate different replies to the same prompt because it was programmed to be a probabilistic system. The replies are sometimes realistic and often humorous, which shows how well the model has learned to mimic human language style and nuances.

In order to understand how ChatGPT works, one must understand how a Transformer-based language model works. Hence, the speaker proposes to create a simplified model based on Shakespeare's works that imitates the functioning of ChatGPT. This model will be trained how words in Shakespeare's works follow each other. After training, this model can generate an infinite amount of text that resembles Shakespeare's style, akin to how ChatGPT generates its responses.

The two main requirements to understand and appreciate the workings of ChatGPT are proficiency in Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics. This is because creating and training a language model involves writing python code and understanding the mathematical principles behind machine learning algorithms.
