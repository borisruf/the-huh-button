Andrej is explaining that ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, can generate different and creative responses to the same text-based task because it's a 'probabilistic system.' It has been trained to understand the sequence of words in the English language and uses this knowledge to complete the task given to it. Just like in the examples given, where it was asked to write about various topics, and it was able to create unique responses each time.
