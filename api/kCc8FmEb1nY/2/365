The Transformer is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) based on a 2017 paper called "Attention is All You Need". It uses a language model to predict what words might come next in a sequence. For example, if the sequence starts with 'cat sits on the', the Transformer might suggest 'table' as being the likely next word based on prior training.

The ChatGPT, which uses the Transformer, can be trained to respond to prompts in ways that make it seem to understand and carry on a conversation. This can result in different and interesting results each time the same prompt is given. An actual transformer can be trained by using a text file. For example, one could train a model using the complete works of Shakespeare. The model will learn the sequence of words or characters and will then be able to generate new, similar sequences. 

The specifics of how to create such a model can be found in the GitHub repository 'Nano GPT'. It comprises of two filesâ€”one that defines the Transformer model and another that trains it with a given text dataset.
