The speaker is setting up an AI program on his computer. He will make it learn the order of words in Shakespeare's complete works. The AI will try to 'predict' the next letter based on the letters it has been given. Then, the speaker plans to let the AI generate its own 'Shakespeare-like' text. The respective code is stored on a website called GitHub.
