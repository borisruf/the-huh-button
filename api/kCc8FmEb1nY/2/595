Andrej explains that we can use a simple programming model called Transformer to replicate the process behind the complex artificial intelligence system, ChatGPT, although making it work exactly like ChatGPT is complicated because it requires large-scale training and fine-tuning. He suggests using a simplified dataset, his favorite being a compilation of works by Shakespeare, to predict character sequences and create infinite, albeit imperfect, Shakespearian text. Python knowledge and some understanding of calculus and statistics, Andrej says, are enough to understand his demonstration.
