The text is talking about how machine learning models process text. It explains that the model reads text as numbers rather than words. To do this, it uses a process called tokenization. This is where each character in the text (like 'h', 'i', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'e') is assigned a unique number. The model can then use these numbers to understand, and make decisions based on, the text. The reason for this is that machines, like computers, find it easier to understand and process numbers compared to words. The process is reversible, so after the model has done its task, we can convert the numbers back into text.
