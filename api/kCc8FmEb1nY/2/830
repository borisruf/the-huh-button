In simpler terms, the speaker, Andrej, is explaining that he will teach the viewers how to build and train a language model based on the Transformer neural network. The language model will be trained using the text of all of Shakespeare's works. Afterward, this model can be used to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's style. Andrej will guide the viewers step by step to construct this from scratch in Python, helping them understand how sophisticated systems like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) - used in applications like ChatGPT - operate. To follow along, viewers need to have a basic understanding of Python, calculus, and statistics.
