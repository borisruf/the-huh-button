Andrej explains that he is going to teach his viewers how the Chat GPT, an artificial intelligence language model, operates by building a model from an educational perspective using Shakespeareâ€™s works as a data set. He specifies that although they can't replicate the complexity of Chat GPT, his aim is to demonstrate the inner workings of such a model as it's trained to predict the sequence of Shakespearean text, character by character. The model he is going to train will be able to predict and generate Shakespeare-like language indefinitely. He states his goal is to help viewers understand and appreciate how Chat GPT operates.
