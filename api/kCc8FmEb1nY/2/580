This passage is about using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate text. It talks about a system called 'ChatGPT' that can produce text based on prompts given to it. For example, if you ask it to write a haiku about the importance of understanding AI, it will generate a poem. ChatGPT produces its responses by using a language model, which looks at a sequence of words or characters and predicts what should come next based on patterns it sees. 

The speaker in this passage wants to explain how ChatGPT works, and so he proposes to build a simplified version of it. Instead of using the huge amount of data that the real ChatGPT uses, he suggests using a collection of all of Shakespeare's works. This data is fed into a type of AI called a 'Transformer', which learns the patterns of Shakespeare's language. Once it's been trained, it should be able to generate text that looks like Shakespeare's. 

To start the process, the speaker identifies all the unique characters in Shakespeare's works - including letters, spaces, and punctuation. These characters form a 'vocabulary', or set of possible characters that the simplified ChatGPT can use.
