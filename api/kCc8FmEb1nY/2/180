ChatGPT is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to generate text, like writing a poem or a news article. It makes sentences by "predicting" what words come next in a sequence. An important part of ChatGPT is a framework called Transformer that was created in a 2017 research paper. This Transformer blueprint has been used in many other AI applications with only small changes.
