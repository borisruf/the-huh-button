Andrej is talking about a type of artificial intelligence called ChatGPT. He explains that this AI can receive a prompt, or a starting phrase, and it will generate text based on that prompt. This can lead to many different responses each time you ask the AI the same prompt. Andrej likens this to the AI completing a sequence of words.
