The statement refers to a method of using AI or a language model program, similar to ChatGPT (a popular AI text generator). The presenter is explaining how text generation works by using a character-based language model trained on a complete works of Shakespeare's script. This model generates text going character-by-character and predicts the next character based on the previous ones. The generated text has a Shakespearean language style, and while it might not make perfect sense, it reflects the patterns found in Shakespeare's works. The process is similar to how ChatGPT generates text; however, in this case, it's generated character by character.
