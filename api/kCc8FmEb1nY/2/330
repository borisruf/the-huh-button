ChatGPT is a computer program that can create text that is meant to sound natural and human-like. More specifically, it generates text at a token by token level. A token in this context is like a small piece or chunk of a word. It's not just one word, but a part of a word or a combination of words. The program uses these tokens as building blocks to string together sentences and longer stretches of text. Because of this approach, the program is able to generate quite complex and varied responses.
