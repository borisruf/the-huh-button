The speaker is explaining how interesting and versatile the AI system called ChatGPT is. It can understand written tasks and creatively respond in different ways. For instance, it can write poems or even witty comments. People have been finding this quite impressive and amusing. Technically, it's called a 'language model' because it can understand and predict how words in the English language typically follow each other. 

The core technology that drives Chat GPT is something called a 'Transformer', which was first introduced in a research paper in 2017. Despite the paper being about machine translation, the Transformer model it proposed has become very important in AI and is used in lots of different ways, including at the heart of Chat GPT. The speaker now wants to explain how something like ChatGPT can be built.
