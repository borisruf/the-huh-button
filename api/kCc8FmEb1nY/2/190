The technology used in this very popular language model, ChatGPT, is based on a specific type of architecture called 'Transformer'. This structure was originally meant for translating languages, but it has since been used in many different areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The good thing about Transformer is that you can use it in most applications with just a few little tweaks. Here, Transformer is used to help the AI write and "understand" the sequence of words in English. So, for example, when we tell the AI to write a haiku about AI, it's using this Transformer structure to put the right words in the right order. This has been a very influential piece of technology in AI.
