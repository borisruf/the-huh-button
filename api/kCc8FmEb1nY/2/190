In the video, Andrej is talking about an artificial intelligence system called ChatGPT. He explains that ChatGPT is a 'language model', which means it recognizes how words in the English language follow each other. When he gives it the beginning of a sentence or idea, ChatGPT completes it by generating the rest of the sentence. However, as evidenced by the different responses to the same prompt, he points out that ChatGPT's responses are not always the same because it's a probabilistic system that can generate multiple answers for the same starting point.
