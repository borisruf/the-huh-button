Sometimes, researchers create a new technology or concept, but they don't fully realize how big of an impact it will have. For example, a paper was written in 2017 called "Attention is All You Need", and this paper suggested a new idea in the field of AI, called the Transformer. The Transformer has been a big game-changer in AI. 

Now, a specific example of AI that uses the Transformer is an AI system called ChatGPT. ChatGPT can write creative and unique responses to any text you give it, like writing a news article about a tree leaf falling, or a poem about the importance of understanding AI. 

But if you were to read the original paper from 2017, you might find it a bit confusing or random, because it doesn't look very special. That's probably because the people who wrote it didn't really understand how much of a big deal their new idea, the Transformer, would be.
