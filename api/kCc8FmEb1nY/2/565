The passage is from an educational video lecture on how the language model, called ChatGPT, can respond to text-based tasks creatively by creating sequences with outcomes. It explains how you can give a nuclear network the start of a sequence, and it will complete the sequence based on previous training. To illustrate this, the narrator wants to build a simple character-level language model using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. Applying the model to the dataset, the program can predict the next likely character following a given sequence, thus modeling patterns in the data. The narrator also mentions a GitHub repository called Nano GPT, consisting of code to train the Transformers. The key takeaway is the demonstration of how underneath, ChatGPT works in a sequential manner, and its applications can be expanded with adequate training data and accurate initial sequences.
