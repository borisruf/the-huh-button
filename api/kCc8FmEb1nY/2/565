This is a large passage from a lecture or tutorial about an artificial intelligence technology called Chat GPT. The speaker is explaining how Chat GPT works and how it can generate unique content based on prompts provided to it. The speaker then talks about the underlying AI technology used by Chat GPT, called a Transformer. The speaker is planning to teach viewers how to construct a similar but simpler system, training it on a dataset of Shakespeare's works. The line "Here, I open the "input." is likely a command in a programming language where the speaker is opening the imported file to use data inside it for the next steps.
