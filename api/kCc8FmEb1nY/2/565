The explanation provided is about how a language model, a type of artificial intelligence system, generates language that sounds like William Shakespeare. It notes that the AI model called ChatGPT creates responses based on a given prompt. The AI was designed using a type of artificial intelligence architecture called Transformer, from a 2017 paper named "Attention is All You Need".

The speaker then details the idea of creating a simple version of the model, but instead of using all of the internet as data, they plan to use a small text dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This dataset contains all of the works of Shakespeare and will train the model to generate language that sounds like the famous playwright.

The speaker goes on to explain how such a AI model works. It does so by predicting the next character in a sentence based on the characters that came before it. Once the model has been trained, it can generate seemingly infinite pieces of text that sound like they could be written by Shakespeare.

Theyâ€™ve already written the code to train the model, but plan to show viewers how to build it from scratch. The ultimate goal is to help viewers understand how AI like ChatGPT works. The only requirements are proficiency in Python and basic understanding of calculus and statistics. They suggest watching their previous videos for clarification on the language modeling framework they are working within.

They conclude by explaining how the AI model will 'tokenize' the input text. Tokenizing means converting raw text into a sequence of integers based on a vocabulary of possible elements. The model will analyze individual characters and translate them into integers. The speaker plans to explain this process further using code examples.
