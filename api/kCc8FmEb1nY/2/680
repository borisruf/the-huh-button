In this transcript, Andrej mentions using a toy dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' to train a Transformer-based language model. He describes how the neural network will be taught to predict the sequencing of characters in Shakespearean texts. After training the model, the system can then generate sequences of text that resemble Shakespeare's style of writing. Andrej clarifies that regardless of the text complexity, the process is similar; the model generates text in a sequence, whether it is predicting character by character as in the case of 'Tiny Shakespeare', or token by token (sub-word pieces) as in the case of the AI system ChatGPT.
