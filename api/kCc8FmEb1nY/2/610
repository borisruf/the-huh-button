Andrej describes how he plans to use a smaller, simpler language model called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He explains that, in order to train this system, he is going to predict what comes next in a sequence of characters. After proper training, he should have the ability to generate infinite 'fake' Shakespeare. He also mentions that he is going to write from scratch a repository for this system. He says that all that is needed to follow along and understand how this works is basic proficiency in Python and basic understanding of calculus and statistics. Andrej aims to provide an understanding and appreciation of the underlying workings of AI models like Chat GPT.
