The author explains how to encode and decode strings in a character-level language model like ChatGPT. They suggest iterating through the characters of a given text and creating a dictionary or lookup table that maps each character to a unique integer, and vice versa. To encode a string into numeric form, this process involves converting each individual character into its corresponding integer. The reverse process, decoding, involves translating the series of integers back into their corresponding characters to retrieve the original string.
