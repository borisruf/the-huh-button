Andrej is explaining a concept about an advanced artificial intelligence system known as ChatGPT, and how he plans to design a scaled-down version of it. He explains that the AI system works by generating a sequence of characters or words that follow each other logically in English, essentially completing a sentence or sequence he starts. Andrej plans to demonstrate this concept by using what he calls the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which contains all the works of Shakespeare. He will train the AI model to generate sequences of text that resemble Shakespeare's style of writing. Using this simple demonstration, he aims to help viewers understand how complex AI systems like ChatGPT work.
