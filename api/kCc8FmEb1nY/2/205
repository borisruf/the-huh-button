This means that when you provide the AI with an initial set of words, phrases, or even just a concept, the AI will generate a continuation of your provided input. Just like if you started telling a story, and then someone else continued it for you. In the context of the AI, the continuation it generates is based on its understanding of similar texts it has been trained on.
