Andrej is talking about an AI program called 'ChatGPT'. This program uses a system called a 'Transformer' to form responses to text-based prompts. The Transformer works by predicting what comes next in a sequence of words or characters. Andrej wants to make people understand how this system works by creating a simplified version of it. He plans to use a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which contains all the works of Shakespeare. The AI will be trained to predict what character comes next in a sequence from the dataset. By doing this, the AI will learn patterns in the text. Once trained, the AI should be able to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing. This method of training is similar to how ChatGPT works, but on a simplified level. Andrej has prepared code for this project which is available on his GitHub. He will use a programming tool called Google Colab to develop the code and show people how it works.
