The person is preparing to dig into the details of a machine learning model called Transformer, which is the main component in making the famous AI chatbot ChatGPT work. They plan to recreate a simplified version of ChatGPT using this Transformer model, training it on a dataset referred to as 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all of Shakespeare's works. They'll use this artificial intelligence to predict the next character in a given sequence from Shakespeare's works, creating an endless stream of 'Shakespeare-like' language. The person's well-documented step-by-step process will be outlined in a Python-based Google Colab Jupyter notebook, which they intend to share for others to learn and follow along. As part of this process, they're opening an "input" file, likely the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset they've downloaded.
