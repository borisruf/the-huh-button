Andrej wants to create an AI model similar to Chat GPT, but instead of using the Internet, he will use a smaller dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This dataset contains all the works of Shakespeare. Andrej will use this data to make the AI learn the patterns of Shakespeare's language and create a system that can produce Shakespeare-like text indefinitely. Andrej explains that there is a difference between how the AI learns with this dataset and ChatGPT. While the ChatGPT forms responses based on parts of words, his version will model characters instead. Andrej has already written codes to train his model and he plans to build it from scratch on his YouTube channel.
