To create a simplified version of ChatGPT, we plan to train a Transformer-based language model. These types of models understand how words or characters follow one another in English. In our case, we will be focusing on creating a model at the character level, which means it will predict the next character of the sentence based on the previous ones. This technique is a bit simpler and more straightforward compared to the advanced system of ChatGPT, which operates at a more complex level and incorporates a larger scope of language understanding.
