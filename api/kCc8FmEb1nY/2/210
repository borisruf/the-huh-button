In really simple terms, we can think of this system like a very smart predictor. Imagine if I start telling you a story and then stop, this system will try to guess and complete the rest of the story. How it completes the story can be different each time. So, if I give it the beginning of a story (the start of a sequence), it provides what might come next in the story (the outcome).
