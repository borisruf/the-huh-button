In simple words, this means that you give the program the beginning portion of a series or pattern of things (like words or numbers) and it will come up with what it predicts should come next to continue or finish that pattern. For example, if the sequence is "1, 2, 3..." and you give it "1, 2, 3", it might predict "4, 5, 6" to complete the sequence.
