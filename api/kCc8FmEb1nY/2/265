The Transformer neural network, a machine learning model, reads a sequence of characters and tries to predict what character comes next. It's like it's learning to understand patterns in how letters commonly follow each other in words. For instance, it might see the characters 'do' and guess that the letter 'g' often comes next. This is useful for things like AI chatbots, which need to generate human-like text. The Transformer network learns from reading large amounts of text data, such as English documents, to understand these patterns.
