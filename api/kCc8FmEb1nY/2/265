Andrej explains that ChatGPT is an AI system that can generate multiple text-based responses depending on the task given, or 'prompt'. It's like an interactive tool that you can chat with - you input a sequence of words, and it completes it in a variety of ways. This AI system is often referred to as a 'language model' because it learns how words usually come after each other in English. For Andrej, the AI system is simply filling in the rest of the sentence after he gives it the beginning.
