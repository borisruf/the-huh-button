We are going to create a simpler version of ChatGPT using the Transformer architecture, focusing specifically on creating a system that can predict the sequence of characters in text like a language model. Instead of using a vast amount of internet data, we will use a smaller data set called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all the works of Shakespeare. The objective is to design our 'character-level language model' to understand and predict how characters follow each other based on a given set of characters.
