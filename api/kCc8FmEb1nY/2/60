A prompt is a message or question that you give to an AI system like ChatGPT. It then gives you back an answer or a reply. If you give the same prompt more than once, the AI may generate different replies each time since it uses probability to generate its answers - just like in our example where we asked it to create a haiku about AI and prosperity. This is called a probabilistic system. It can reply with different responses to the same prompt.
