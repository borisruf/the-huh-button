ChatGPT is a computer program that can write text based on what you tell it to do. It's like playing a game of chance - each time you ask it something, you might get a different answer. For example, if you ask it to write a short poem about the importance of understanding artificial intelligence, it could write one version now and another version later. This means that ChatGPT does not always give the same answers but can generate multiple responses.
