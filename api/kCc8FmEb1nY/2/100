A 'language model,' like ChatGPT, is a tool that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words. This helps it to make sentences that make sense. It's like the program is finishing your sentences, but it's predicting based on the words or characters you've already given it, and it can do this in many different ways. That's why it might give different responses to the same prompt.
