This amazing system is known as a 'language model'. It works by predicting the sequence of words, or generally tokens, in a way similar to the order of how we use language. Think of it like a computer program that knows how to arrange or rearrange words and characters to make sensible sentences. Like how we humans learn to form sentences by understanding the sequence in which words usually come, this language model does the same thing. The result is that it can generate multiple appropriate responses to any given input or question.
