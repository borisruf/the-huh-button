Andrej is explaining that ChatGPT is a computer system that can generate text in response to whichever sentence (or 'prompt') you give it. He mentions that it's incredibly versatile and can write in various styles, depending on the prompt. Also, its responses can be slightly different even if given the exact same sentence to start with, showing that it doesn't just follow a strict formula but generates unique answers.
