Andrej explains that he aims to provide a general understanding of how the GPT chatbot, an AI system capable of creating text similar to humans, works. He mentions that he already has a GitHub repository called 'Nano GPT' which has all the code required for these AI systems, including one called 'Transformer', which he will use to train his AI model on a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This dataset comprises all of Shakespeare's works, and the AI trained on it will be able to generate text similar in style to Shakespeare's writing. Andrej emphasizes that although the AI he will create won't be as advanced as GPT, it will still serve as a good learning exercise to understand AI language models better. He will do all this via a Google Colab Jupyter notebook which he will later share for others to follow his process.
