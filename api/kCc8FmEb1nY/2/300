This text is talking about an artificial intelligence program called ChatGPT, which is capable of generating human-like text based on the inputs it receives. They use an example of asking ChatGPT to create a piece of text in the style of Shakespeare. After being "trained" with Shakespeare's works, the AI is able to predict and generate text that is similar to Shakespeare's language and style. Some unexpected errors or 'junk' might appear in the text generated, but overall, the AI successfully creates a text that resembles Shakespeare's writing.
