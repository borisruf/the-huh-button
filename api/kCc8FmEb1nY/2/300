This AI (ChatGPT) is sort of like predicting the end of a story based on the beginning. You give it the first part (a sentence or phrase), and it guesses how the rest should go based on what it knows about language and previous examples it has seen. It's like completing a puzzle - you provide the starting pieces and it tries to fill in the rest in a way that makes sense.
