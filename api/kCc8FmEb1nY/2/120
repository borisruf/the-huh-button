This passage is talking about ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system. ChatGPT can write text, similar to how a human would write, when given a prompt. It can come up with different responses to the same prompt because it is a 'probabilistic system'. For instance, if you ask it to write a haiku about the importance of understanding AI, it will generate different poems each time. This is because ChatGPT, as a language model, understands how words follow each other in the English language. The text suggests that this work, like completing a sequence of words in a sensible way, is what makes it special. The author then implies that they are going to elaborate on how ChatGPT functions.
