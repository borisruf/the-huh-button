ChatGPT is like a super smart writing assistant. You give it a few words or a sentence, which is like the beginning of a story (we call this the 'sequence'). Then, this assistant thinks about what words usually come next in such a story (based on a huge amount of texts it has seen before). It then writes the rest of the story for you. Itâ€™s not always the same story for the same beginning, it can come up with different endings!
