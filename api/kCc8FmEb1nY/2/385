The speaker has made a simple version of a model used for language AI like ChatGPT. They've made it very basic and trained it using a Shakespeare dataset, called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. They've used a specific type of AI model, called the 'Transformer', which they have coded into two separate files. After training their model with the dataset, the model can generate text that somewhat resembles the style of Shakespeare's writing. They've included their work in a Github repository called 'nano GPT'. They demonstrated that their code was successful by reproducing a smaller model that contained 124 million parameters. This was just to confirm that the code was correctly organized and worked as expected.
