ChatGPT is like a computer assistant that finishes your thoughts. You give it a starter sentence, like the first few pieces of a puzzle, and it will arrange the rest of the pieces to provide a fitting conclusion. It uses its understanding of language to fill in the gaps, predicting the best words to come next to complete the sentence or story.
