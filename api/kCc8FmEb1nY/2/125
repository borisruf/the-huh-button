The neural network under the hood of Chat GPT is a type of machine learning model known as a transformer. Transformers use calculations and predictions to understand the context and relationships between different words in a sequence. It then uses this understanding to predict or generate the next words in the sequence. This enables Chat GPT to create coherent and contextually appropriate responses to the prompts it is given. Transformers are particularly good at understanding language due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies between words and their ability to process parts of the sequence simultaneously instead of one word at a time. This neural network is the core system that allows Chat GPT to function as a language model.
