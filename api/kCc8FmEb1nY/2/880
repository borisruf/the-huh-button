Andrej is explaining that he will demonstrate how ChatGPT, a language model, works. He plans to create a simplified version of it using a data set consisting of all Shakespeare's works, which he refers to as the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. The model will be trained to generate sequence of words that resembles Shakespeare's writing style. The goal of this demonstration is to help the audience understand how ChatGPT operates. He also mentions that he has written entire code for training these models in his GitHub repository called Nano GPT.
