The speaker wants to develop a program in the Python programming language that can predict the next character in a text sequence, given a number of previous characters. The task involves reading a large file containing collected works of Shakespeare.

The file is read as a sequence of individual characters. To help the program make predictions, the speaker creates a list which contains each unique character that appears in the file. This list is sorted, giving each character a specific place or 'order'. This helps to organize the data when the program is making its predictions. 

In simple terms, the speaker is instructing the computer to 'learn' the way characters are ordered in Shakespeare's work. After this 'training', the computer should be able to predict the next character when presented a sequence of characters.
