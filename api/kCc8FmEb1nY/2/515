The speaker, Andrej, is saying that he will demonstrate how to create a simple version of the ChatGPT AI model. He is going to use a 'toy' pre-existing dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all the works of Shakespeare. He will train his model to predict the next character in a sequence based on previous characters, just like ChatGPT does with words. This process will essentially train the model to generate text that is somewhat similar to Shakespeare's works. He also explains that his implementation will be simple and people with basic understanding of Python, calculus and statistics can follow along.
