Andrej discusses creating a simplified version of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system that uses sequence of text for different tasks. He explains how it uses a neural network called a Transformer based on a paper called "Attention is All You Need". They will not recreate the exact system, but will instead take a simpler dataset, 'Tiny Shakespeare', to train a smaller, character-level version of the model. The purpose is to teach how these types of systems work. By doing so, Andrej demonstrates that this 'Transformer' system can predict the next character in a sequence from the dataset. They aim to generate text that imitates the language of Shakespeare. All codes and training materials are available in a GitHub repository called 'nano GPT'. His goal is to help those watching understand how Chat GPT operates.
