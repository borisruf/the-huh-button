ChatGPT is a program that generates text by predicting the next word in a sequence. I can train a similar program using a simple Transformer and a dataset from the works of Shakespeare. Through this, I aim to give you an understanding of how ChatGPT works. Instead of generating individual words, we'll generate individual characters in this instance. This differs from the practice of using sub-word units, which is generally used when generating text in practice, as OpenAI does with its 'tick token' library, which uses a 'pipe pair encoding tokenizer'.
