ChatGPT is a computer program that can write text when it is given something to start with, known as a 'prompt'. It is like a very advanced version of predictive text. If you ask it the same question or give it the same prompt twice, it can give two different answers. This is because it works on probability which means it considers different possible ways to continue from the prompt before choosing what to write next.
