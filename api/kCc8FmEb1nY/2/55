A prompt is a question or instruction that you give to the AI system to make it create a text. For example, asking the AI to write a poem about the importance of understanding AI is a prompt. The AI then replies to it by generating its own text. But because the AI is designed to make different choices, it can produce various responses to the same prompt.
