The author is discussing an AI language model called ChatGPT, which generates and completes sentences based on a given prompt. He explains how the AI uses a neural network, called Transformer, to predict the next character or chunk of text based on patterns in the English language. For demonstration, he uses the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset as a training sample, and the model produces sentences that mimic Shakespeare's writing style. He also mentions that the detailed code for training these Transformers is publicly available in a GitHub repository.
