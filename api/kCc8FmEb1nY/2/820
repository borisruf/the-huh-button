In this text, 'open the "input' refers to the process of the speaker preparing to interact with a file (in this case, the "Tiny Shakespeare" data set) in the Google Colab Jupyter notebook. Opening an input can mean reading a file, loading data, or getting ready to handle some information. By doing this, the speaker can examine and work with the contents of the file in their code.
