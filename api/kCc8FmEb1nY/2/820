This text is essentially explaining language modelling using AI. The speaker uses chat models that are built to generate responses in specific sequences, in this case, words following each other in English. They delve into the neural network (in particular the Transformer architecture) that forms the basis of such models. In an effort to bring this high concept to life, they propose creating a miniature version using the works of Shakespeare. They explain how they will take all of Shakespeareâ€™s works, compress them into a single file, and then train a neural network to predict what character (letter) comes next in the sequence, based on previous text. The general idea is not to have the network perfectly reproduce the exact works of Shakespeare but for it to generate Shakespeare-like text.
