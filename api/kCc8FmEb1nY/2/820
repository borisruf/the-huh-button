In the video transcript, the speaker, Andrej, explains how ChatGPT, an AI model, works. He describes how it can generate different responses for the same input and create humorously appropriate text. Later in his talk, he introduces the concept of a language model and elaborates further on how such models can be built using a notable AI paper's Transformer architecture. Towards the end, Andrej mentions that he has written code to train such models and shared it on GitHub. He concludes by expressing his intent to start building a simpler Transformer-based language model from scratch in a follow-on lecture, using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'.
