In the video, Andrej shares how a language model called ChatGPT, designed by OpenAI, works. He explains that the model interacts with input (or prompts) and generates a response in a sequence of words. It is not absolute and can offer different responses to the same prompt due to its probabilistic nature. Andrej then explains that this language model uses a technology called Transformer, which is what helps the model understand the sequence of words in English. He then reveals his plan to train another language model using "Tiny Shakespeare," a smaller dataset with all of Shakespeare's works. This model will predict the next character in a sequence, allowing it to develop a "Shakespeare-like" language. Lastly, he announces that he'll walk the viewers through the process of creating a similar simpler model from scratch using Python, calculus, and statistics.
