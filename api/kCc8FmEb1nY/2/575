In this context, the speaker is explaining how the ChatGPT model, an AI system capable of generating human-like text, works. They use the model to generate a few results based on different prompts. Now, they are preparing to go 'under the hood' of this AI model, intending to explain how to train a similar system. The speaker introduces the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which includes all of Shakespeare's works, as the training material for their model. They highlight the unique characters (letters, spaces, and punctuation) used in the dataset; these elements form the 'vocabulary' that the model can recognize and generate. The next step is to develop a method for tokenizing the input text, or breaking it down into smaller pieces that the model can process.
