Andrej, the speaker, is discussing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system called Chat GPT which is capable of generating human-like text by building sequences of words, similar to the way humans form sentences. He introduced a simpler version of this AI system called Nano GPT for training purposes. This system is being trained on a simplified dataset, 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all of Shakespeare's works. The aim is to have the AI predict the next character in a sentence from Shakespeare's works, thereby generating a Shakespeare-like text. He explained that the same method can be applied to any text dataset. Understanding how Nano GPT works can help understand the mechanism behind more complex AI systems like Chat GPT. Andrej has prepared a coding tutorial to illustrate this process, which requires some knowledge of Python, calculus, and statistics.
