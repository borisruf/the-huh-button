In this passage, the speaker is explaining about an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system known as "ChatGPT". They describe it's ability to generate human-like text in response to prompts given to it. They further explain how it uses a language model to generate responses and mention its neural network, the Transformer. The speaker plans to demonstrate how to create a similar, simplified version of the system using a much smaller data set from Shakespeare's works.
