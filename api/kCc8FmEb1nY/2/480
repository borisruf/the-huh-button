Andrej is explaining how a particular artificial intelligence (AI) system, known as ChatGPT, functions. He mentions that this system works as a 'language model', which means it is capable of generating various phrases or sentences based on a given input or prompt. Essentially, Andrej indicates that this AI system has been trained to predict what letter or word comes next in a sequence. This process is primarily driven by what's called a 'Transformer', a kind of AI model created in 2017, and he is about to guide viewers through the process of making a similar model from scratch, using a collection of Shakespeare's works as material for teaching this model how to generate sentences.
