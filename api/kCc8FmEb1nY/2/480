The speaker is demonstrating how ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence model, works. They mention that the model uses a system called Transformers to predict the sequence of words or characters in a text. In order to understand this system better, they suggest trying to build a simpler version using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which includes all of Shakespeare's works. The model should be able to observe patterns in this data to predict what character is likely to come next in a sequence. By doing this, the speaker aims to show the underlying mechanisms of models like ChatGPT.
