The speaker is discussing ChatGPT, which is an AI language model that is capable of interacting with humans and completing tasks. The tasks can vary and include writing haikus, breaking news articles, explanation of different topics, and more. They propose to illustrate how ChatGPT works, particularly the architecture of the model, by creating a simpler version that uses the Transformer, the neural network that models the sequence of words. The model will be trained on 'Tiny Shakespeare', a dataset comprised of all the works of Shakespeare. After the training, the model should be capable of generating text resembling Shakespeare's works.
