The speaker, Andrej, is explaining how the AI system Chat GPT works and how it generates text. He refers to it as a 'language model' because it can predict what word should come next in a sequence. Andrej suggests using a reduced version of all Shakespear's works to train the AI to model how characters follow each other. By doing this, the AI can imitate Shakespear's language style and generate infinite, 'fake Shakespeare'. Andrej then discusses NanoGPT on his GitHub, which trains Transformers on any given text. He plans to start a new project on training a Transformer on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, in order to better understand the inner workings of Chat GPT. He stresses the prerequisites of Python proficiency and basic understanding of calculus and statistics before attempting this project.
