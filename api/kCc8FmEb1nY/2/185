What this means is that the structure of the technology used in ChatGPT, known as the Transformer architecture, was introduced in a research paper in 2017. It was initially designed for translating languages, but has since been slightly modified and widely used in a number of AI applications beyond translation, including Chat GPT. This architecture enables the AI to predict and generate sequences of words, making it capable of carrying out complex tasks such as writing poems or generating responses to prompts.
