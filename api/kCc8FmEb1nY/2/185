Andrej is explaining how ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, works. He shares that when you give ChatGPT a sentence or an idea (called a "prompt"), it generates a full text in response, which completes the prompt. This process is sometimes slightly different even if the same prompt is used, because ChatGPT is a 'probabilistic system', which can provide many responses to the same prompt. He ends by saying that ChatGPT is a type of 'language model' which can predict how words follow in sequence, essentially completing sentence prompts given to it.
