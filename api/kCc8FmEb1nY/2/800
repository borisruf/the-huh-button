Andrej's explanation in the video revolves around explaining how a Chat GPT, a transformer-based, language model works. He explains that he plans to use a smaller data set, 'Tiny Shakespeare', to demonstrate how sequences of characters are predicted by the transformer model. Andrej highlights that the predictive ability of the transformer model underpins powerful artificial intelligence applications like Chat GPT. As an example, he demonstrates how, after training, these models can generate Shakespeare-like text character by character. He concludes saying he aims to build a transformer model from the ground up, to train it on the Tiny Shakespeare data set, and help his viewers understand the working mechanism beneath Chat GPT.
