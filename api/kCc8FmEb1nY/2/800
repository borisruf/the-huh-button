In this portion of the discussion, the speaker is explaining that they will split the data set they are using (in this case, all the works of Shakespeare) into two parts: a training set and a validation set. They do this to more accurately test their AI model. 

The training set is what the model initially learns from, while the validation set is used to check how well the model can apply what it has learned to new, unseen data. This process helps prevent overfitting, which is when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new data.
