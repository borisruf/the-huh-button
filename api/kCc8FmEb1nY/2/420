This speaker is explaining the concept and mechanisms behind the AI model called ChatGPT by OpenAI, highlighting how it generates text responses. They describe it as a 'language model' that completes sequences given to it, and underline that it's based on the 'Transformer' architecture proposed by a 2017 research paper, 'Attention is all you need'. 

The speaker plans to demonstrate how to build something like ChatGPT. As the original model is too complex and requires a considerable amount of internet data to create, they suggest training a 'character-level language model' using a smaller file containing all the works of Shakespeare.

Once trained, this abridged model can generate text emulating Shakespearean language, although not perfect. The speaker has written a simple implementation of this project and uploaded it to a GitHub repository called 'Nano GPT', which anyone can use to train their Transformers on any text data set. The final goal of the lecture is to rewrite the entire codebase from scratch, so the audience understands the full process.
