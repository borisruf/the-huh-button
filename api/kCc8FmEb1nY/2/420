ChatGPT is a computer program that can generate text. If I give it the start of a sentence or idea, it can finish it for me. It doesn't always give the same answer, and sometimes it can come up with funny or unexpected responses. It knows how words usually go together in English, and it uses this knowledge to make its responses.
