Chat GPT is an AI system that you can interact with and give text-based tasks to. For the same task, it can give different responses based on probability. It's a language model - it models the sequence of words, characters or tokens. It's called a Transformer because it transforms given text into a coherent response. To help you understand how Chat GPT works, we're going to train a smaller model on a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This dataset contains all of Shakespeare's works. Once trained, the model will be able to generate text in a Shakespeare-like style. Although we won't be able to recreate the complexity of Chat GPT, this simplified model can help you understand how such AI systems work.
