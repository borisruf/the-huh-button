Andrej explains that they can't replicate ChatGPT due to its complexity, but will demonstrate how to build a Transformer-based language model using a condensed collection of Shakespeare's works. They will teach the model to predict the sequence of characters in this text. After training, the model will be able to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing style. Andrej aims to help the viewers understand how Chat GPT operates. Prior skills in Python and basic knowledge of calculus and statistics are necessary for this.
