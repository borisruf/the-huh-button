The speaker is talking about a coding process for a neural network model like ChatGPT. While discussing a demonstration of a training process for this model, they mention the act of opening "the input". This simply means they are starting to read or load the data that they are going to use to train or test the model. Typically, this data is stored in a file or a database, so "opening the input" might involve opening a file or establishing a connection to a database.
