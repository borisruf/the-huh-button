This basically means that you can choose to have a small selection of letters, numbers, and symbols (known as the codebook or vocabulary) but create long strings of these elements. Alternatively, you can choose to have a large vocabulary but restrict the length of the combinations you make from it. It's your choice how lengthy your sequences are and how varied the elements within them can be.
