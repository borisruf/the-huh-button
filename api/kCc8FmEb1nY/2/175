The speaker is talking about a computer program called ChatGPT that uses artificial intelligence to interact with users and complete tasks involving text. The system works by generating responses to prompts, which can vary each time even with the same prompt. It does this by predicting the sequence of words based on what it has learnt about the English language. 

The main focus for the speaker is to talk about the underlying technology that makes ChatGPT work. This is based on something called the Transformer, which was first proposed in a scientific paper published in 2017. The speaker believes that the authors of this paper underestimated the impact the Transformer would have, as though their work seemed ordinary, it actually had major implications for the field of artificial intelligence.
