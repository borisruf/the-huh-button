The text talks about how the ChatGPT AI system can generate customized text based on given prompts. The speaker then explains how this system works. ChatGPT uses a language model that makes predictions on what could come next, based on the sequence of words, characters, or tokens it's given. 

The speaker then explains an example using the Transformer neural network model. They use the "Tiny Shakespeare" data set, which has all of Shakespeare's works in a single file. The model predicts the next character based on the previous ones in the data set. 

The speaker also talks about a GitHub repository they've created, which contains code to create a similar model. They end by discussing how to create a tokenizing strategy to convert the raw text from the Shakespeare data set into some sequence of integers, which will be used in the model.
