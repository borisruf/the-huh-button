In simple terms, when AI or language models process sentences, they don't look at the entire word or individual characters. Instead, they break down words into smaller pieces or units, also known as sub-words, and encoding or recognizing these units. This approach facilitates better language processing and understanding, especially in dealing with variations and complexities of different languages.
