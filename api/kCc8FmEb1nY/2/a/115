ChatGPT is a computer program that can generate text independently. It's like a smart computer that can reply to what you ask it to do. For example, if you ask it to make a poem, it can create a poem for you. If you ask it to write a funny story, it will make a funny story for you. It doesn't just repeat something it has learnt before, instead it can give different answers to the same question. This is because it is designed to understand how words and sentences typically follow one another. So when it writes, it is like it's completing a sequence of words. It's been trained to do this by learning from a lot of different texts. It can even do funny things, like write a breaking news story about a leaf falling from a tree!
