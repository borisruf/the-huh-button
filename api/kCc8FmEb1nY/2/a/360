Nano GPT is a program I created and stored on a platform called GitHub. This program is designed to help train Transformers. These aren't the robots from the movie, but rather a type of artificial intelligence that can be taught to create text that looks like it was written by a human. It does this by learning what sorts of words or characters commonly follow one another in a sequence. For example, if it sees the word "The", it might guess that a noun or adjective is likely to come next. With enough training, Transformers can write coherent and even creative text. In short, Nano GPT is a tool to help teach a computer how to convincingly pretend to be a writer.
