The speaker is discussing how the AI program ChatGPT works. It can generate different responses from the same prompt because it's a probabilistic system. The core of ChatGPT is a system developed in 2017 called a "Transformer" that models sequence of words and phrases. Despite its complexity, the speaker wants to demonstrate how to train a simplified version of this AI model, but doesnâ€™t want to use a large amount of data from the internet as the full-scale ChatGPT does. Instead, a smaller data set will be used.
