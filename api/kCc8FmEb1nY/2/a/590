This text is about how to create a system that can generate language in the style of a particular writer, like Shakespeare. At the heart of the process is a neural network called a 'Transformer,' which looks at a sequence of characters and predicts what character will come next. 

First, the whole works of Shakespeare were combined in one massive text file. From there, the system looks at each character in the sequence and predicts the following character. By practicing this over the complete works of Shakespeare, the system is trained to generate sequences of characters that sound like Shakespeare.

The text then talks about taking the raw text and 'tokenizing' it, which means converting the text into a sequence of numbers. Each number represents a character from the text. This all happens in a programming language called Python, and the complete code can be found on GitHib under the repository called 'Nano GPT.'
