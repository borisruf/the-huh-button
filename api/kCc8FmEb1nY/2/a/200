ChatGPT is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to generate text. It's like having a conversation with a robot. You can ask it to write poetry, explain complex topics, or even perform creative tasks such as writing fictional news stories. It's flexible because it can give different responses to the same question. This program is based on a type of AI called a "Transformer", which is a way of teaching computers to understand language patterns. I want to make something similar to ChatGPT.
