In this script, the speaker gives a brief introduction about ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. It's a system that interacts with humans, and users can assign it any text-based task. The speaker also gives various examples of the tasks given to ChatGPT, and then explains that it can generate multiple responses because it is a probabilistic systemâ€”meaning, given a single prompt, it can yield multiple outcomes. 

The creator then goes on to discuss that ChatGPT employs an architecture called 'Transformer', which originally comes from a landmark AI paper titled 'Attention is all you need'. This 'Transformer' neural network essentially does the heavy-lifting part in the AI model.

The speaker further explains his plan to build a Transformer-based language model using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The idea is to use a 'character-level language model', which would model the sequence of words as characters, predict the next character in a sequence based on the preceding ones, thereby generating a sequence that looks like Shakespeare's writing. 

In the end, the speaker mentions a code repository called 'Nano GPT' that he has made to train Transformers. His ultimate goal in this lecture is to help the audience understand how the 'ChatGPT' system works. For this, the speaker suggests watching his past videos where he explains simpler neural network language models, specifically, the 'Make More' series.
