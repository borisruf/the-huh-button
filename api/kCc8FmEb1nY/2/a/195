This system called ChatGPT creates different answers to the tasks or questions given to it. It's like a program that can understand and predict what words should come next in a sentence. The technology it uses to do this was first introduced in a research paper about machine translation in 2017. Though the original purpose of this technology was translation, its ability to predict and produce sentences was adapted into many other AI applications, including ChatGPT.
