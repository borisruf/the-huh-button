The speaker discusses an AI program named ChatGPT that can generate text based on prompts given to it. It is possible to ask ChatGPT to generate poems, news articles and various forms of writing. For ChatGPT to create such text, it uses a process called "neural network" which is based on a technology known as 'Transformers'. These Transformers help the AI understand how words typically come together to create sentences, ultimately helping it generate responses or complete sentences. The speaker next plans to illustrate how this system works by creating a simple version that uses the works of Shakespeare as a basis for learning and making predictions. The speaker has written code that trains these Transformers, to generate Shakespearean-like text.
