This passage is talking about a computer program called ChatGPT, which is designed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with people and complete tasks using written text. An example given is asking ChatGPT to write a short poem (haiku) about the importance of understanding AI in order to make the world better. The responses ChatGPT gives are a little bit different each time because it's not just following a fixed script, but using probability to choose what to say. This means it can give a range of answers to the same question.
