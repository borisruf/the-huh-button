The speaker is discussing how to create a model based on the Transformer architecture, which powers machine learning systems like ChatGPT. This type of model takes text entries and processes them character by character to predict the next likely character.

The speaker is training this model using a text file containing the complete works of Shakespeare. First, the file is downloaded and loaded as a string, giving around 1 million characters of content. This raw text is made into a list of all unique characters that appear in the text, sorted into order. There are 65 different characters in total, including spaces, special characters, and capital and lowercase letters.

The next step is to tokenize this text. Tokenization in this context means converting the raw text from string format into a sequence of integers, with each unique character assigned a corresponding integer based on an established vocabulary of characters.
