The speaker is demonstrating how to interact with an AI language model (ChatGPT) to generate unique text, such as news articles or stories, based on provided prompts. He states that while it's not feasible to reproduce the entirety of ChatGPT, he plans to build and train a Transformer-based language model (a foundational component of ChatGPT) to generate text in a similar fashion with the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. This dataset contains all of Shakespeare's works. The speaker's goal is to help the audience understand how ChatGPT works under-the-hood. He also mentions sharing the code developed through a collaborative platform called Google Colab which he is using to write the code. In the end, he starts by opening an "input" but doesn't complete the sentence, so we don't understand what that input is.
