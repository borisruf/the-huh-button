This passage explains the formation and use of language models like ChatGPT and how they are trained to generate text that follows specific patterns based on a given input. The models use different encoding systems to convert raw text into integersâ€”an important step in training the model. This process is called tokenization. 

For instance, the person creating the code uses an encoding process that translates individual characters into integers. This process is described as character-level language modelling. It gives the example of the phrase "hi there", which is encoded into a sequence of numbers like 46, 47, etc. Decoding is the reverse process, where numbers are translated back into the original characters.

However, the person also mentions that this is only one way of encoding and there are many other tokenization methods out there. Some libraries use a sub-word tokenizer that encodes parts of a word rather than individual characters or entire words. For GPT2, an encoding system called 'tick token' is used, which has 50,000 possible tokens instead of just 65.
