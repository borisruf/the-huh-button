The speaker is trying to explain how the AI system ChatGPT works and wants to teach how to construct a similar language model. He demonstrates how ChatGPT can generate different responses to prompts by highlighting a few examples. He describes the significance of the Transformer architecture in building such AI applications and discusses a paper that first presented this concept.

He then mentions that he will demonstrate how to build a smaller language model based on the Transformer architecture using a dataset called Tiny Shakespeare. He explains that he will train the model to predict the next character in a sequence from this dataset. This model, once trained, can generate text that imitates Shakespeare's writing style. 

The speaker emphasizes that the aim is not to replicate the sophisticated application of ChatGPT, but to help the audience understand the inner workings of such AI systems. He presents Nano GPT, his GitHub repository containing the codebase intended to help this understanding.
