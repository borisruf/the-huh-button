This passage talks about the functioning of ChatGPT, an AI language model. It explains how this AI system processes text and can create unique responses to prompts, as it is built on probabilities. This AI model was built on a neural network called a Transformer, which looks at a sequence of words or characters and predicts what is likely to come next. It also discussed about using a subset of this model, which will focus on predicting the next character in a sequence from works of Shakespeare as an example.
