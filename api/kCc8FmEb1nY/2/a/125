ChatGPT is a computer program that can generate human-like text. It works by using what you give it as a starting point, and then it predicts and writes the rest of the story, poem, news article, or whatever you've asked for. So, if you give it the beginning of a sentence, it uses its understanding of language to finish that sentence in a plausible way. It can generate different responses each time, even if you start with the same sentence. It's like how if you're playing a game and you throw a ball in a certain direction, although you might expect it to go a certain way based on how you threw it, the wind or other variables could make the ball take a slightly different path each time. Just like you understand a lot about how to throw balls, ChatGPT understands a lot about how words in English normally go together. That's why its responses generally make sense and why we call it a 'language model'.
