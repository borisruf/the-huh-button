The Transformer neural network is a type of artificial intelligence that predicts what comes next in a sequence, based on the context of preceding characters. The text given to it serves as clues to help it guess what follows. For instance, if the given text is "dog", the neural network might predict that the next character is 's', forming the word "dogs". This is how it can generate entire sentences or even stories based on a prompt or starting sequence. ChatGPT, an AI that uses this system, can take text-based tasks and generate responses in a variety of ways.
