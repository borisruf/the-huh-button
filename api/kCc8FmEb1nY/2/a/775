The speaker is demonstrating how to build a simple version of ChatGPT, which uses AI to generate relevant responses. They will be using a character-level language model trained on all of Shakespeare's works â€” which can then generate a seemingly infinite array of Shakespearean-style responses. To accomplish this, they first need to "tokenize" the text, converting it into a series of numbers that can be processed by the AI. Although there are more complex tokenization methods (like sub-word encodings), to keep things simple, they will use a character-level tokenizer for their demonstration.
