The person speaking is discussing a language model called ChatGPT, which is a computer program that generates human-like text. This program can create different responses for the same input, showing its capability to generate a wide variety of responses.

The discussion then shifts to the underlying technology called the Transformer architecture, which makes ChatGPT work. This was originally designed for machine translation -- converting text from one language to another -- but has become vital to many other areas in artificial intelligence as well.

However, the person believes that the creators of the Transformer didn't realise just how important and versatile their creation would become for the entire field of AI.
