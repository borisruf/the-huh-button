This file contains all of Shakespeare's works, which altogether is about one megabyte in size. We will use this file to train a language model to understand how the characters (letters, not people) in Shakespeare's works follow one another. This will help us predict what character is likely to come next given a sequence of characters. It's like teaching a computer to write in the style of Shakespeare.
