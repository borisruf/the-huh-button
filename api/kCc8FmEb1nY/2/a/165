The speaker is talking about ChatGPT, an AI system which uses words to reply to written requests. The system can create different responses to the same request, because it's designed to respond in various possible ways. It works by predicting the sequence of words based on what it's been given to start with. The technology that helps ChatGPT produce these responses is named 'Transformer' and it was created based on a paper published in 2017. This paper might seem to be about something different, but it's actually where the ideas for this technology come from.
