The speaker is talking about a powerful language modeling AI named ChatGPT, which uses an "under the hood" system based around a neural network called a "Transformer," first introduced in a 2017 paper titled 'Attention is all you need.' GPT, the abbreviation for the specific type of Transformer used, stands for "generally pre-trained Transformer." 

As a language model, ChatGPT uses this system to sequence words, characters, or tokens in order to produce coherent and intelligent responses to prompts provided by users. The speaker provides several examples of prompts and responses, highlighting the AI's ability to respond creatively and contextually. 

The speaker notes that ChatGPT can return different yet reasonable outputs from the same prompt, indicating its probabilistic nature and it is highly capable of modeling the sequences of words, essentially 'completing' the sequence or filling in the blanks given a starting phrase or sentence.
