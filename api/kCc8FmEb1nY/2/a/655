In simple words, we're developing a system which will translate or "encode" every character - A to Z in lower and upper case and different special characters - into a number. This is done by creating a 'lookup' table, which is a catalogue of each character and its corresponding number. 

When we want to encode a string of characters, say for instance "hi there", each character in the string is translated into its corresponding number, according to our lookup table. The result is a sequence of numbers.

The good thing about our system is it can work the other way too. If we have a sequence of numbers, we can "decode" it back into the original string of characters. We use our lookup table again but in reverse, converting numbers back into their corresponding character.

This translate-back-and-forth system forms the backbone of our AI model that we're developing to work like a 'language model'. This model is capable of generating sequences of characters, a bit like writing sentences, based on the patterns it has learned from large amounts of text data. This way, it will be able to generate text that resembles the structure and style of the original source, like the works of Shakespeare, for instance.
