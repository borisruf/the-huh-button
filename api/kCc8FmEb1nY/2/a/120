ChatGPT is a computer program that can generate human-like text when given a task. For instance, if you ask it to write a poem about the importance of understanding artificial intelligence (AI), it can come up with a relevant poem. It is even capable of humor by generating unlikely stories when asked, like a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree. It works by predicting the next word or sequence of words in a sentence, which is why it's called a 'language model'. The generated result can vary even with the same input, as it's designed to consider multiple possible responses.
