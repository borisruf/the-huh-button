The person is explaining the process of creating an AI model (more specifically, a language model) for generating text that appears to be written by Shakespeare. They mention that they use a dataset of all of Shakespeare's works, and the AI model is trained to predict the next character in a sequence based on the previous characters it has seen. To prepare the data for the model, they explain how they convert each character in the text into a unique integer â€“ this process is called tokenizing. For instance, they share that there are 65 unique characters (lowercase and uppercase letters, space, and special characters) in Shakespeare's works that they've organized into a sequence of integers. They convert this sequence back to text by reversing this process, which is known as decoding. The integer sequences are longer but easy to manage due to their small, simple vocabulary. In contrast, some more advanced techniques use larger vocabularies and shorter sequences. Finally, they convert all the characters from the Shakespeare dataset into tensors, a multi-dimensional array used widely in deep learning, for further processing.
