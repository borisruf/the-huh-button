A Transformer is a specific type of computer program that can read and generate text. It's called a 'neural network' as it is designed to mimic the way we think our human brain works. Let's take the example of the AI system 'ChatGPT' that uses a Transformer. 'ChatGPT' can understand a question or a task you give it, and then generate a written response or carry out the task. Each time you ask the same question or give the same task, you might get slightly different but relevant responses. This is because it's designed to have probability - like in real life where there can be more than one correct answer to a question. The Transformer is doing the hard work of understanding and generating the responses. It was first introduced in a big research paper in 2017.
