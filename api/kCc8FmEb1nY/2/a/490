In this video you'll learn how chatbots like ChatGPT work. You'll learn about the Transformer Architecture from a landmark paper in AI. This system is what drives the responses from the AI, and it can produce many different and creative results. 

The speaker is going to demonstrate how to build a similar system using a collection of Shakespeare's works. They will be training the system to predict what character comes next in a sequence of characters, using the Transformer Architecture.

They will also be explaining the details of the system, and comparing this simplified version to ChatGPT. 

They have also shared a space where they have written code to train these Transformers and where you can check it out. 

Lastly, they will recreate this system from scratch in a live session, explaining each step so that those watching can follow along and learn. The code will be available later in the video description.
