Nano GPT is a collection of computer code files, or a repository, available on GitHub. It's designed to train a type of artificial intelligence model called Transformers. Transformers are useful because they can understand and generate human-like text based on the information they've been trained on. The Nano GPT can be used to train a Transformer on any text you want.
