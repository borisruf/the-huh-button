The phrase "Here, I open the 'input'" refers to the act of the speaker accessing or opening the input file or data that they are using. In this case, this would be the Tiny Shakespeare data set that is mentioned prior. This could be done using a programming command or function that reads and loads data from a file into the program so that it can be manipulated and used in the analysis or model that is being developed by the speaker.
