The 'under the hood' component of ChatGPT is a type of neural network known as a transformer model. This is what allows ChatGPT to model or predict the sequence of words. It can understand the context of a sentence based on the words that come before and after a specific word. Itâ€™s like how our brain process information - by taking in a series of words, making sense of how they are linked, and predicting what might come next. This allows the AI to generate responses to prompts in a very human-like way.
