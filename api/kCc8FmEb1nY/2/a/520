This is a detailed description of the workings of ChatGPT, a very effective artificial intelligence (AI) model that can generate realistic and contextually relevant text. The speaker goes on to discuss how ChatGPT can produce multiple, varied responses to a single prompt and how people have found creative ways to extract humorous responses from it.

The speaker then introduces the concept of the BERT Transformer, the underlying neural network that allows ChatGPT to function. He mentions a 2017 paper titled 'Attention is all you need', which first proposed the Transformer architecture and chronicles how it came to dominate many AI applications.

Going forward, the speaker plans to demonstrate how to create a Transformer-based language model, training it on a 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. He emphasizes that the model will focus on character sequences, meaning it will predict the next character in a series given a certain context. He also acknowledges that while this model wonâ€™t be as sophisticated as ChatGPT, it helps understand how these AI systems work.

Last but not least, the speaker points to a repository of code that he has written to train these Transformers, inviting viewers to follow along with this lecture by creating a similar model themselves.
