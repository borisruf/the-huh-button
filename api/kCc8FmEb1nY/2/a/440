In this lecture, we're going to train a model using AI and the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, which contains all of the works of Shakespeare. This will help us understand how the sequences in texts follow each other. Our model will learn to predict what character is likely to come up next based on past patterns. Once trained, our model can generate text that seems like it was written by Shakespeare indefinitely. We can apply this method to any text data that we want.
