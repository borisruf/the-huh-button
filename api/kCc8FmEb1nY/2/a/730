The explanation is about how we transform raw text into numbers so that it can be inputted into an AI model. In this case, for the AI model ChatGPT, each letter or character from a written text is assigned an integer value. The process of assigning these numbers is called encoding. The example uses a string "High there", and each letter in the string is assigned a specific number. However, these numbers are not between 0 and 64, as might be expected with 64 possible characters, but are between 0 and 50,256. This means there's a larger range of possible values because different combinations of letters or words could also have their own specific number, not just individual characters. This method allows the AI model to predict or generate language much more efficiently.
