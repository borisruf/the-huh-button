ChatGPT is a tool that generates written content based on prompts. It works by analyzing and responding to text that we provide. In this example, it created a short poem or haiku when asked. The interesting thing about ChatGPT is that it doesn't always generate the same response for the same prompt. In this case, when asked the same question again, it produced a slightly different haiku.
