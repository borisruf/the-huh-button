'Sentence piece' is a method used by Google to encode text into smaller parts, also known as tokens. Instead of breaking down the text into individual characters or whole words, 'sentence piece' splits it into smaller pieces that are more meaningful than individual characters but don't necessarily represent whole words. This can make the information easier for machines to process.
