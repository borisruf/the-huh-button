The speaker is discussing the development and use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system that completes text-based tasks. The AI analyses prompts given to it and generates a response based on its programming. It's a flexible, probabilistic system - meaning it can generate different outcomes or answers for the same prompt. The speaker plans to delve into the brain of the AI, the Transformer, and will aim to create a simplified version of it. Instead of using all the material from the internet, like the original ChatGPT, they will train their simplified version on a smaller set of data - the works of Shakespeare. Their goal is to teach the AI how characters in this body of work relate to each other.
