This is a long explanation about building a simple language model using a Transformer neural network, an AI technology, with the text from Shakespeare's work as the training data. This AI model is made to predict the next character in a Shakespearean sentence by learning the patterns in which characters follow each other in Shakespeare's text. The speaker also discusses how this simple model works similarly to the complex language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can generate human-like text based on provided prompts. The speaker points out that this model training will be conducted with Python coding, highlighting that understanding Python, calculus, and statistics are basic prerequisites.
