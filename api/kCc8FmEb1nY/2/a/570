The speaker is describing a language model, known as ChatGPT, which works based on the sequence of words or characters. This language model can create simulated dialogues based on a given prompt, and every time it has diverse outputs, it reveals its probabilistic nature. The speaker has decided to train a Transformer-based language model on a dataset called Tiny Shakespeare, which compiles all of Shakespeareâ€™s works. The goal is to teach the neural network how the characters follow each other to generate words. While running the model, the speaker expects the network to generate infinite Shakespeare-like text. For coding purposes, the speaker mentions the GitHub repository named Nano GPT, allowing one to train Transformer with only 300 lines of code. The speaker aims to make you understand how ChatGPT works with simple steps like defining a Transformer, training it on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, and generating infinite Shakespeare. However, the prerequisite for this is a good grip on Python, calculus, and statistics. 

Lastly, the speaker reads the Tiny Shakespeare data and views the unique characters used in the text, establishing a potential vocabulary the model may generate.
