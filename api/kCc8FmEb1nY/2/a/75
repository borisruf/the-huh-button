ChatGPT is an Artificial Intelligence system that can respond to text instructions. For instance, we can ask it to write a poem about the value of understanding AI, and it can generate different responses. Even if we give it the same instruction more than once, it won't always give us the same answer. This is because it's designed to come up with a range of possible responses. A lot of people have had fun experimenting with ChatGPT and asking it all sorts of questions. In fact, there are entire websites dedicated to showcasing these amusing interactions.
