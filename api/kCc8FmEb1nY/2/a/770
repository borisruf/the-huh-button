The speaker is explaining how they intend to create a simple model for generating text that's similar to what the AI model ChatGPT produces, but on a smaller scale, by using a character-level language model.

They plan to train the model on a dataset called Tiny Shakespeare, which is a compilation of all of Shakespeare's works. The process involves predicting the next character in a sequence after a given set of preceding characters, thereby creating a sequence that mimics Shakespeare's style.

Before starting, the speaker prepares their dataset. They identify the unique characters in the entire body of text, listing and sorting them. Each unique character is then assigned a unique integer, allowing for the conversion of raw text into sequences of integers, and vice versa.

However, the speaker notes that this is a very simple form of tokenization. Other methods include sub-word encoding, which is slightly more complicated but generally more efficient.

In conclusion, the speaker is proposing to build a simple character-level language model to generate text, with the understanding that the sequences produced may be very long because of the simplicity of the model.
