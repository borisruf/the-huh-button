This speaker is explaining ChatGPT, a task-oriented AI that can complete prompts with a range of responses using language modeling. This is the process where the AI predicts the next sequence of words in a sentence based on the words that have come before it. 

The speaker also refers to the Transformer neural network, which is the fundamental framework that powers this model. This system was proposed in a landmark AI paper titled 'Attention is all you need'. 

The speaker plans to create a simpler version of chatGPT, using the Transformer architecture, to demonstrate how it works. This scaled-down model will predict the sequence of characters instead of words using the complete works of Shakespeare. Once trained, this model can generate an infinite number of Shakespeare-inspired texts. 

To understand the process better, the speaker also refers the viewers to a Github repository called Nano GPT, where AI enthusiasts can find easily implementable code to train Transformers on any text data set. Finally, the speaker mentions previous videos on the same channel that help build foundational understanding of neural network language models.
