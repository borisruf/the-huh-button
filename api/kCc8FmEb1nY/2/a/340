Tokens in the context of artificial intelligence and language models such as ChatGPT refer to smaller chunks of information that the AI uses to generate text. Rather than processing information at word level, these pieces of information, or 'tokens', can be part of a word, a whole word, or even multiple words. Breaking text into smaller chunks helps the AI understand, analyze and generate language in a more nuanced way. This granular approach to language processing contributes to ChatGPTâ€™s ability to generate realistic and coherent sequences of text.
