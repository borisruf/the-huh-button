This passage is about an AI model named ChatGPT built by OpenAI. The AI can generate text in response to different prompts. It works like a language model, predicting the next word in a sentence based on the words before it. The model uses an architecture called the Transformer. The author wants to build something similar to ChatGPT but will use a smaller data set called Tiny Shakespeare. After training the model on Tiny Shakespeare, it can generate infinite Shakespeare-like text. The author also mentions that he has written code to train this model, and if you train it on the Open Webtext data set of web pages, the model's performance is similar to an early version of GPT (GPT2).
