The speaker is going to demonstrate how to create a language model similar to ChatGPT, a widely used artificial intelligence text-based system that can generate a variety of replies based on a given prompt. Rather than using the same complex training methods and extensive internet data used for ChatGPT, the speaker will use a simpler data set known as Tiny Shakespeare, which includes all of Shakespeare's written works. The speaker will start from scratch with an empty file and define a Transformer neural network, piece by piece, which mimics the way words follow each other in the English language. The ultimate goal is to train the model on the Tiny Shakespeare data set to predict the next character given a specific context of characters and use it to generate Shakespeare-like text.
