This individual is outlining the beginnings of creating a transformer neural network model, specifically for text. He discusses using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, which contains all the works of Shakespeare in one text file. When all the characters from this text are compiled, they form the "vocabulary" of the script. Each character is then assigned an integer identifier, transforming the text into a sequence of numbers. This process is known as tokenization. The discussion then compares different types of tokenizers. For this project, a character-level tokenizer will be used, which will result in longer sequences but smaller vocabularies. This sequence of numbers can now be fed into a neural network for the language model.
