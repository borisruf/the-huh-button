The speaker is explaining the process of encoding and decoding text for use in a language model. They discuss different methods of 'tokenization', which is the process of converting raw text into a sequence of integers. They use a character-level tokenization for their example, turning individual letters and symbols into a sequence of integers. They note that other methods, such as sub-word encoding, can use larger code books (sets of valid tokens) but result in shorter sequences. The method they choose to use depends on the specific needs of their model. For their example, they chose to use a simpler method with a smaller code book.
