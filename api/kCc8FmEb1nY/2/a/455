This is a lecture about ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system that interacts with users to produce a variety of text-based tasks. The chatbot uses a language model to generate these responses, based on the sequence of words provided by the user. The underlying architecture of ChatGPT is called a Transformer, which is a form of neural network that is able to model sequences of words. 

The speaker suggests that watching this lecture will help students understand how ChatGPT works under the hood. To illustrate, they detail a plan to use a smaller, simpler dataset called Tiny Shakespeare to train a Transformer-based language model.

Anyone can follow along to understand the workings of ChatGPT. The prerequisites include proficient Python programming skills, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and viewing the speaker's previous video tutorials. The results can be found in Nano GPT, a GitHub repository.
