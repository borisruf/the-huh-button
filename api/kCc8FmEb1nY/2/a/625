In simple terms, this passage talks about how a program interprets a sequence of characters or words. It discusses an artificial intelligence called 'ChatGPT' which understands and generates sentences in English. The AI predicts the probability of the next word in a sentence, based on the words it read in the same sentence. The AI also converts the string of words or characters to numbers (encoding) and then can convert the numbers back to words (decoding). This process can also be referred to as tokenizing. The passage shows that by doing this the AI can be trained to write in a style similar to a specific text (like the works of Shakespeare).
