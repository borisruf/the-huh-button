In this explanation, the speaker refers to the underlying programming that allows an Artificial Intelligence program called ChatGPT to simulate conversation. This AI uses a type of code architecture called a Transformer, which allows it to analyze and mimic nuances in language. The speaker outlines how they're going to use a dataset containing the complete works of William Shakespeare to train this AI. To do so, they will identify all possible character inputs in the dataset (including lowercase and capital letters, special characters, and spaces), which total 65 unique characters. This signifies the range of inputs the AI will be trained on, enabling it to predict and generate responses that echo Shakespeare's language style.
