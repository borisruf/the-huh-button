This passage talks about a technology called ChatGPT, which is a type of artificial intelligence. You communicate with it by typing in tasks and it responds back in words. Just like it wrote two haikus based on the task given to it. Even though it was asked to do the same thing twice, it gave different answers both times. This shows that it doesn't just give one answer but can come up with multiple replies based on the same task. The paragraph also mentions that there are many examples of these tasks and answers available online.
