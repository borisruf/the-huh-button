The person is preparing text (in this case, characters from Shakespeare's works) to be processed by a machine learning model. First, they convert the string of text into a set, which removes any duplications and leaves just the unique characters. Then they turn this set into a list, so the elements have a specific order. Finally, they sort the list in order. This process is necessary to prepare the data for a particular type of machine learning model, a Transformer, which generates text.
