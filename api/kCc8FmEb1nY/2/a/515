ChatGPT is a language model powered by artificial intelligence, which generates text based on word or characters sequences. It's programmed to predict what should follow after a given sequence, which has resulted in a wide range of creative applications. The structure of this system was first proposed in a 2017 research paper titled 'Attention is all you need'. The main focus of this video is to build a Transformer-based language model based on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, a collection of all the works by Shakespeare. The aim is to model how characters (the smallest unit in the English language) follow each other in this context. After setting up and training the model, the system should be able to generate text that is similar in style to Shakespeare's works. All of the code required to set this up is available on Github in a repository titled 'Nano GPT'. This entire project is aimed at explaining how ChatGPT works and doesn't endeavour to recreate the same level of sophistication.
