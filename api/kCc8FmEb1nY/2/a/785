The speaker is familiarizing the audience with the PyTorch library and the torch.tensor from the PyTorch library. The speaker is using a haiku to demonstrate how Transformer based models, often known as GPT models, can generate seemingly unique responses to the same prompt. The Transformer is criticized as a non-deterministic function, meaning that it can provide different outputs when asked the same question multiple times.

The speaker is using an application called ChatGPT as an example. The speaker is going to build out something like ChatGPT, and will start by training a Transformer-based language model. The speaker is going to use a smaller dataset known as Tiny Shakespeare dataset. Subsequently, the speaker is going to predict the characters following other characters in the texts of Shakespeare's works. The speaker installs Nano GPT from Github, which is a repository for training Transformers. Finally, the speaker begins coding in Python, using PyTorch.
