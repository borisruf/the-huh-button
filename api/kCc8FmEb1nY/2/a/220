In simpler terms, the speaker is explaining about an AI system named ChatGPT, which can creatively respond to various text inputs. For example, it can create a haiku or write a news article about a leaf falling from a tree. This flexibility is because the system works as a 'language model', meaning it has learned to predict how words follow each other in the English language. The speaker intends to explain more about this process by focusing on training a similar, but a simpler kind, of model known as a Transformer-based language model. This Transformer technology is the core technique used by ChatGPT to understand and generate language.
