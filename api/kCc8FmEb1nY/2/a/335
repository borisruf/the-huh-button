The text is talking about two language models - one used by the AI program ChatGPT and another one the speaker is going to build based on Shakespeare's works. Language models predict what comes next in a sequence of words or characters. ChatGPT generates its responses word by word (or token by token), while the speaker's model, trained on Shakespeare texts, will predict the next character based on previous ones. So, if given part of a sentence from a Shakespeare play, the model should be able to predict what character comes next.
