The speaker is explaining that they're training an AI model called ChatGPT on a database containing all of Shakespeare's works. This will allow the model to create text that is similar to Shakespeare's writing style because it learned from his works. It means that we can use this AI to generate a limitless amount of text that imitates Shakespeare's style, but it's important to remember this text is not genuinely created by Shakespeare itself, but by the AI program. Also, there may be some irrelevant parts in the text (the speaker called it "junk") as the program sometimes makes mistakes and produces content that doesn't make sense.
