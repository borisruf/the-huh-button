The speaker is introducing a complex topic related to AI, talking about a system called Chat GPT that can generate different responses based on the prompts given to it. The speaker then discusses an architecture called Transformer that underlies the workings of systems like Chat GPT, and how it has greatly influenced recent AI applications. The speaker also calls attention to a source code for something called 'nano GPT' that they have developed and made publicly available on GitHub, which allows for the training of Transformers using any given text. This code has been used to reproduce the performance of an early version of GPT from OpenAI. For their demonstration, the speaker proposes using a compact dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. They explain that after training their Transformer on this data, it will be able to predict and generate character sequences that closely resemble Shakespearean language. The speaker then explains that they're using a tool called Google Colab to create and share a program that will generate this Shakespearean text. Finally, they mention opening the "input".
