Google uses a 'sentence piece' to encode text into numbers. This is a method to turn words or phrases into numerical values, which is crucial for machine learning models to understand and process language. Unlike turning each character into a numerical value, 'sentence piece' does this for whole words or even phrases. So, instead of mapping each character to a number, it maps larger 'pieces' of sentences to numbers. It's a different method, compared to the example in the text that only translates individual characters into integers, and uses a different vocabulary or 'lookup table' to do that translation.
