This is about a tool called ChatGPT, which is a type of artificial intelligence that interacts with humans by completing written tasks. For example, you can ask it to write a haiku or a breaking news article. It generates different versions of a response based on the task given. It essentially works by completing a sequence of words. You provide the start of a sequence, and it continues the sequence to produce an outcome. This is why it's called a 'language model' - it simulates how words follow each other in the English language.
