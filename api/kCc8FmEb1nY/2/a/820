In this long explanation, the speaker is walking the audience through the creation of a language model called ChatGPT, a type of artificial intelligence. 

The speaker shares that this AI is trained using large quantities of text from the internet and can generate unique responses to text-based prompts, often with a great deal of creativity and humor. As a demonstration, the speaker uses a small sample of Shakespeare's entire works, the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, to train a simple version of ChatGPT. The steps involve transforming the text of Shakespeare's works into a sequence of characters (the tokenizer), which are then turned into integers, resulting in a long sequence of numbers that represents the original text (the encoder).

The speaker emphasises that in actual practice, a more complex tokenizing scheme would be used, called a 'sub-word' scheme, which balances the length of the sequence against the number of unique characters or tokens used. However, for simplicity, a character-level scheme is used in this demonstration.

The speaker then shows how these steps can be accomplished using code and the PyTorch library, which works with tensors (a kind of multi-dimensional array). The result is a huge sequence of integers that represent the original Shakespeare text, which can then be used to train the model.
