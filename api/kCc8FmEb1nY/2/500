In this section, the speaker is explaining the process of preparing a text file for training an AI model, focusing on the specific stage of character/word extraction from the text. The speaker is discussing a specific AI model called ChatGPT and the process of teaching this model to simulate written language, in this case, the works of Shakespeare. 

The speaker begins by loading the entire text of Shakespeare's works into Python as a single string of characters. They then transform this long string into a Python 'set'. The reason for doing this is to identify all the unique characters used in the text. 

In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. In the context provided, when they convert the string to a set, the set constructor will create a collection of all unique characters present in the entire Shakespeare text. This step is crucial to understand the dataset (here, different characters from the text), which will later be used in teaching the AI how characters/words follow each other in a typical Shakespeare play.
