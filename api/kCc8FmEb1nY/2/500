The speaker is talking about opening a text file named 'input.txt', which contains all of Shakespeare's works. The file is then read and the complete content is brought in as one long chain of text, or string. Understanding the logic or sequence in how the characters in this string follow each other helps in predicting what comes next. This principle is used in training AI models to generate human-like text.
