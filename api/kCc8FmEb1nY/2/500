The speaker, Andrej, is talking about the capability of the AI model called ChatGPT. He explains how it can generate text based on an input sequence, essentially completing a text prompt he gives it. This is because it has been trained to understand how words in the English language commonly follow one another. As an example, Andrej illustrates how the model can generate text that appears to be written by Shakespeare when it is trained on all of Shakespeare's works (referred to as 'Tiny Shakespeare'). He then proposes to create simpler versions of these Transformer language models in order to better understand how they operate.
