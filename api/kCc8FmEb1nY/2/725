The speaker in the context is talking about creating a language model that can generate text similar to Shakespeare's work using a machine learning model called a 'Transformer'. They explain that by training this model on all of Shakespeare's works (the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset), the model can learn how characters sequentially follow each other in the English language of Shakespeare's writings. Then, given a sequence of characters, the model can predict the most likely next character based on the patterns it analyzed during training. 

Towards the end of the text, the speaker reveals plans to write code that will define and train this Transformer model from scratch using Python and a open-source Jupyter notebook. The corpus of information required for this includes an understanding of Python, basic calculus and statistics, and familiarity with previous videos from their YouTube channel that introduce language modeling framework.
