Andrej is explaining that he will be demonstrating how to create a language model similar to ChatGPT, but using a simpler, smaller dataset. He will use a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which contains all the works of Shakespeare in a single file. Like ChatGPT, the model will predict the next character in a sequence, based on the sequence of characters it has seen before. Once trained, the model will generate text that imitates the style of Shakespeare. Andrej plans to write out this process from scratch and encourages viewers to follow along with the coding. His aim is to help viewers understand how Chat GPT operates, using Python, calculus, and statistics knowledge. To aid this learning process, he refers to a previously developed code he's authored and wants to re-create for the audience using the Google Colab platform.
