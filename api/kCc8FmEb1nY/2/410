The speaker wants to demonstrate how the ChatGPT language model works by building a simpler version from scratch. Instead of using the large volume of internet data that ChatGPT is trained on, he will use a smaller dataset consisting of all the works of Shakespeare, known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. After training the model, it will be able to predict the next character based on the previous ones in a sequence of Shakespeare's text, generating infinite Shakespeare-like language.
