The AI compares a set of previous letters to predict the next letter in a sequence, this is done by a system called Transformer. This process is similar to how ChatGPT works. For ChatGPT, we normally give it a small start of a sentence and it gives back an entire paragraph. For the AI we are discussing, we give it a sequence of characters, and it will try to predict the next character.
