The text is explaining what a language model is, and how it is trained to predict and generate sequences of words or characters that follow a certain pattern. 

Here, the AI system ChatGPT is used as an example to show how a language model works. With a given set of words, ChatGPT can generate a variety of responses, making unique sentences each time it is given the same prompt. This is why it is called a 'probabilistic system.' 

The system is then trained on a dataset called Tiny Shakespeare, containing all of Shakespeare's works. It operates on a ‘character-level,’ where it is trained to predict the next letter based on the sequence of letters given. In the end, the trained model can generate fake Shakespeare-like text, showing its capability of understanding and producing language patterns, similar to those of Shakespeare's works.
