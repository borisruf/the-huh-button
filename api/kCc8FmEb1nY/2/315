In his video, Andrej explains that ChatGPT is an AI system that can complete a sequence of words based on given prompts. He uses examples to show how it creates different responses to the same input. Andrej describes it as a 'language model', meaning it's able to predict and generate words in a sequence which makes sense in the English language. When he gives the AI the start of a sequence, it finishes the sequence with an appropriate result.
