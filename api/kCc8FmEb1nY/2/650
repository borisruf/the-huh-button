Here, "I open the input" is in reference to the speaker about to load or open the file that contains the Tiny Shakespeare dataset they plan to use for their project. This could involve using a command or function to read and load the file's content into their program or script, so they can then use the data in the file for further processing or analysis. Opening a file is often one of the initial steps in data analysis, especially in machine learning and AI projects.
