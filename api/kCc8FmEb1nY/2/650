Andrej discussed how ChatGPT functions. The AI responds to text-based prompts by generating words sequentially much like a human would in conversation. He noted that the AI provides multiple responses to the same prompt due to its probabilistic system, making it versatile in its use. Andrej explained that ChatGPT is a 'language model' that knows the sequential flow of words in English. He then touched on the Transformer architecture, the neural network that powers the AI, and highlighted that it is used widely in AI applications. Andrej wants to build a similar, simplified language model using Transformers and train it using a small dataset of Shakespeare's works, aptly named 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He demonstrated pre-trained model output, which generates text in a Shakespearian style. Finally, Andrej introduced his GitHub repository called 'Nano GPT', a simple implementation for training Transformers on any given text. This series aims to explain how ChatGPT operates, and this particular lecture will focus on building a Transformer model from scratch.
