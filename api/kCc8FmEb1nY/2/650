"Tick Token" is a library created by OpenAI. It uses a pipe pair encoding tokenizer, the same mechanism used by ChatGPT. This function allows parts of words, full words, or even whole sentences to be converted into a format that the computer can easily understand and is a very efficient way of feeding data to the machine learning model.
