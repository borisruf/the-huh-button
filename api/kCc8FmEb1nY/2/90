ChatGPT is an AI system. You can talk to it by typing in text and it will respond. For example, you can ask it to write a short poem or answer questions. It doesn't always answer the same way; sometimes it gives different answers. It has been used to answer lots of different types of questions, some of which are funny. One example was asking it to write a news report about a leaf falling from a tree, which it did in a fun and exaggerated way.
