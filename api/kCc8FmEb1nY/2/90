AI system named ChatGPT has been quite the talk amongst everybody. It's a program that lets people interact with an intelligent machine and provide it with tasks. You can, for instance, request it to compose a short poem on the significance of comprehending AI and its potential to enhance the world and bring prosperity. Here's a haiku that ChatGPT came up with: "Knowledge brings prosperity for all to see. Embrace its power." It's interesting to note that when this AI system was prompted it came up with two different yet similar outcomes, thus revealing its probabilistic nature. There's a vast range of prompts and interactions people have used with this AI. Some examples include humorous ones like, "Explain HTML to me like I'm a dog.", "Write release notes for Chess 2.", or "Write a note about Elon Musk buying Twitter."
