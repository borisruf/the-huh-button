This is saying that when you give the AI, ChatGPT, the beginning of a sentence or a phrase, it produces the rest of the sentence or phrase. It's like starting a puzzle and letting the program finish it using its understanding of language and context. Similar to when you start a story and let someone else complete it, this AI does something similar, but with texts.
