The speaker is explaining the concept of a language model, specifically ChatGPT, that uses a specific architecture called the Transformer to generate language. The Transformer neural network takes a series of words or characters, and tries to predict what should come next based on patterns it has learned from training data. They use an example where the model is trained on a dataset of all of Shakespeare's works, which is smaller and manageable compared to the huge amount of data the full ChatGPT model is trained on. The goal is to make the model to predict the next character in a sequence in a way that mimics Shakespeareâ€™s writing style, essentially generating 'Shakespeare-like' text. The speaker mentions that while the generated text might still have some issues and may not be perfect, it does demonstrate the basic idea of how the language model works.
