Andrej is explaining that ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence system that generates responses based on text inputs or prompts. He points out that this system can produce different responses to the same prompt because it operates probabilistically. He refers to it as a 'language model' because it can predict a sequence of words or tokens, given the start of a sequence, effectively completing the sequence with a relevant outcome.
