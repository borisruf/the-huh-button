This paragraph explains that we will divide the data set we're using to train our AI into two parts. We'll use 90% of it as training data, which will help our AI learn the task we are teaching it. The remaining 10% will be used as validation data, which we can use to test our AI and see if it's correctly learned what we taught it. The validation data helps us see if our AI has only memorized the training data (overfitting), or if it actually understood it and can apply the same rules to new data.
