Andrej explains that he is going to demonstrate how to build a simpler version of ChatGPT using a language model called 'Transformer' and a small dataset taken from Shakespeare's works. He says he can't recreate the full complexity of ChatGPT, but the aim is to help viewers understand how it operates. Andrej also plans to write and train the Transformer model from scratch, which, when completed, should be able to generate text that simulates Shakespeare's writing style. He mentions his codes are available on GitHub in a repository named 'nano GPT' and that he is conducting his demonstration using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook.
