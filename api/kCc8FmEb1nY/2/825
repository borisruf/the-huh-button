Andrej, the speaker of the video, explains how Chat GPT, an artificial intelligence system, works. He demonstrates that it's an AI capable of generating text when given a specific prompt, much like a human would. As part of explaining further, he plans to develop a simplified version of this system using a portion of the works of Shakespeare as its basis for learning and generating 'Shakespeare-like' text. He aims to help viewers understand how such AI systems function by creating and training a Transformer neural network from scratch. He makes it clear that he's not attempting to replicate the complexity of Chat GPT in full, but instead focus on its key concepts. His goal is to demystify the workings of the technology behind Chat GPT.
