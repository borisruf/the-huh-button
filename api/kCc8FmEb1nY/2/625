Andrej explains the working magic behind Chat GPT, a language model that can generate meaningful sentences like a human. He points out that Chat GPT is built on a type of neural network known as the 'Transformer', which was initially designed for machine translation. By 'training' this Transformer network on various pieces of text, he shows that it can predict the next letter or word in a sequence, mimicking the structure and vocabulary of the training data. Andrej plans to demonstrate this process using a small set of works by Shakespeare, aiming to build a simple version of Chat GPT that can generate 'infinite Shakespeare', although he clarifies that it won't fully replicate Chat GPTâ€™s complexity or fluency. Moreover, Andrej suggests anyone with proficiency in Python, and some basic calculus and statistical knowledge can understand this process by following through his coding tutorials.
