When people talk about programming a language model, they need a way to translate the words or characters they're working with into something the computer can understand. This is called encoding and tokenizing. In one simple method, each unique character in a text is assigned a specific number. For example, the word "hi" might become "12, 9" and the computer would understand that those numbers correspond to "hi". There are many ways to do this and the method can vary depending on the task or the specific model being used. Once the text is encoded, the computer can then process and work with it.
