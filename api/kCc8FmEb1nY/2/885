Andrej explains that the ChatGPT system, an AI which has been trained on a wide range of internet text, can generate text in response to prompts which is similar in style to the original training material. As an example, Andrej shows that when the system is trained on all of Shakespeare's works, it can proceed to create new, Shakespeare-like text. He notes that this process involves the AI predicting what characters or groups of characters (known as tokens) should logically come next in a given sequence, effectively modeling the patterns found in the original text. Andrej has developed a simplified version of ChatGPT which models Transformers, another type of system for making these predictions, and plans to continue developing it in the video.
