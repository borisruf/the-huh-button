The speaker is saying that they opened the "input," which refers to opening a file containing data that will be used in their programming process. In this specific example, the "input" is probably the file containing the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data set, which they downloaded previously.

They will use this text data to teach the model how to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing.
