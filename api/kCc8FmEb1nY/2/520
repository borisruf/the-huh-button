In the video, Andrej explains how Chat GPT, an artificial intelligence system, works. He explains that it is a 'language model', which means the system models the sequence of words or characters. When it gets a prompt, it generates responses based on probabilities. He elaborates that the foundation of Chat GPT's functioning comes from the Transformer architecture, a major concept in artificial intelligence. This Transformer architecture, which can be applied to various AI applications, is the neural network that does the 'heavy lifting' work. The speaker additionally explains that he will create a simplified model based on this structure and train it using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. This simplified model will be able to predict what character comes next in a sequence.
