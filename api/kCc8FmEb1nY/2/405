The speaker, 'Andrej', is explaining that ChatGPT, an AI system, is considered a 'language model'. He says this because it's capable of understanding and predicting how words follow each other in English. He produces a beginning sequence of words, and then ChatGPT completes the sequence, meaning it produces the rest of the words to form a coherent message.
