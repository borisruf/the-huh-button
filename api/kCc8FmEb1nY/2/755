The speaker is setting up their programming environment to start a project. They have created a new Google Colab Jupyter notebook and are beginning to describe the preliminary steps they've already taken. They have downloaded a dataset, which is called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which includes all of Shakespeare's works in one single file. They provide a URL for this dataset. They then announce that they are going to open the "input", which we can infer refers to opening this downloaded dataset or file to begin their project.
