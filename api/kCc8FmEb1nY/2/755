The speaker explains how they will prepare the text in the Tiny Shakepeare dataset. First, the text is encoded. That means changing the text into a numerical format that a computer can understand. After that, the encoded text is converted into a torch.tensor. This will result in a data tensor, which is a type of structure that can hold data and will be used later for machine learning tasks. The idea is to teach the system how characters in texts follow each other.
