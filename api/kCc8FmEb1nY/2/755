Andrej explains that he intends to build a simple version of the Chat GPT system by training a Transformer AI model on a compact dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This dataset comprises all of Shakespeare's works in one file. The aim is to train the AI model to predict the sequence of characters in Shakespeare's works. He also mentions that he will demonstrate how to generate artificial Shakespeare-like content with the trained model. Andrej notes that the actual code for this exercise is available on his GitHub repository.
