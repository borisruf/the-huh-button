Andrej is explaining that he wants to train a language prediction model, using the 'Transformer' neural network and a text data set made up of the complete works of Shakespeare. The ultimate goal of the training is to make the model predict what character comes next in a sequence, using the patterns it identifies from the Shakespearean text. Once it's trained, the language model should be able to generate text that looks like it might be written by Shakespeare. Andrej has already created a code for training such Transformers, which is available in a GitHub repository. He plans to recreate this in the video as an exercise.
