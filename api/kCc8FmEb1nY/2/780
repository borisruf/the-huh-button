The described code in the context is using python to build a basic version of an AI program similar to ChatGPT, which can generate text in the style of Shakespeare based on a data set of all of Shakespeare's works. The created program is called a 'character-level language model', which means it predicts the next character in a sequence based on the characters it has seen so far. 

The code uses a library called Pytorch, and specific function torch.tensor within the library to create the model. A concept of tokenization is introduced: it translates each character in the text into a unique integer, and the model uses these instead of the raw text. This process is required because computer models can't directly understand raw text, but they can work with numbers. In the example, this process is performed at the level of individual characters, but in other cases it might be performed on whole words or sub-words. 

Afterwards, he explains that this model is trained on a "Tiny Shakespare" dataset, a collection of all Shakespeare's works and it is trained to generate new sentences, trying to mimic Shakespeare style of writing. However, as the model works on a probabilistic basis, it can generate a slightly different output each time it is given the same input.
