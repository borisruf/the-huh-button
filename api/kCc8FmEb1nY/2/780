In this context, the speaker is saying he or she is going to open an "input" file. In the world of programming, an input file is usually a file from which a program reads data needed for it to execute. This data can be anything â€“ a text, numbers, images, and so on. In this case, the speaker has downloaded the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset which is one such input file and now he/she is saying they are going to open this input file.
