ChatGPT is a type of AI that can complete tasks based on the text instructions it is given. For instance, we could ask it to create a short poem named 'haiku' about the importance of understanding AI. The AI then generates a poem like "knowledge brings prosperity for all to see. Embrace its power". This shows how we can use AI to create things, in this case, a poem.
