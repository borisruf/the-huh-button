ChatGPT is an AI system that we can talk to and ask to do some writing tasks. For example, we could ask it to write a short poem (a haiku) about how good it is for people to understand AI and how it can make the world better. When we ask this AI to make such a haiku, it writes: "Knowledge brings prosperity for all to see. Embrace its power." It does the job pretty well.
