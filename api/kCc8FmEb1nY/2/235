Imagine playing a fill-in-the-blank game, where I start telling a story and stop partway through, leaving a blank space. Now, it's your turn to guess what should come next and complete the story. That's what this AI does. When I give it the start of a story (the sequence), it guesses what should come next based on what it has learned so far, and tells the rest of the story (the outcome).
