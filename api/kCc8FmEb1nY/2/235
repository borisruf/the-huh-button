This person is explaining how they are going to create a character-level language model using machine learning. This model will predict the next character in a sequence, which can be used to generate new texts. Instead of using a massive amount of data from the internet to train the system, they will use a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This dataset is basically a single file that contains all the works of Shakespeare combined.
