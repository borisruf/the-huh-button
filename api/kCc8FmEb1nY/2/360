The GPT model refers to 'Generative Pre-training Transformer'. This is a type of artificial intelligence system used in language models. These models are designed to understand and generate language that can complete phrases, sentences, even entire paragraphs in a way that makes sense. They work by predicting what word or phrase should come next in a sequence. The Transformer part refers to the specific architecture or structure of the AI system. The GPT model uses this architecture to function and generate language. In essence, it looks at what has been written or said already, and then predicts what should come after that based on patterns and rules it has learned.
