This content is explaining how a language model AI works, specifically ChatGPT. These AIs generate responses or complete tasks based on text prompts given to them, such as writing a poem or news article. The AI doesn't know about the topics, it's just predicting what words or phrases would logically follow the prompt, based on its pre-training on huge amounts of text data. 

This document goes on to say that they will demonstrate how a simpler version of these models can be created. Instead of using the entire internet's worth of text data, they are going to use a smaller dataset, 'Tiny Shakespeare', which is a single text file containing all of Shakespeare's works. They will train this model to predict what characters (letters, not people) come next, based on a given section of the Shakespeare text.
