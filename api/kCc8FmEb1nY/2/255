Andrej is explaining that ChatGPT is an AI system that responds to text prompts. It creates responses sequentially, meaning it creates them one word after another. No matter how many times a prompt is provided, the AI could provide different answers because it is designed to function probabilistically. The main function of this AI is to complete a sequence of words or characters based on the prompt given to it.
