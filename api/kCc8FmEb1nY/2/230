Andrej explains that ChatGPT is a type of AI that can generate various responses to a given prompt. It works by completing sequences of words. It can be given a specific instruction or prompt and it will then generate a text, which could be different each time as it 'learns' from each experience. This makes it a useful tool for creating diverse and creative text outputs.
