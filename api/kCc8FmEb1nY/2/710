In this section, the speaker is starting to code a basic version of a language model similar to ChatGPT using a Transformer-based approach. Here, the "input" is the data from Tiny Shakespeare dataset, which is a very small dataset containing all the works of Shakespeare. The AI will be trained to generate characters in sequence that might follow after a given character sequence from this dataset. When he says "Here, I open the 'input'", he means that he is loading the dataset to be used in the coding process.
