Andrej wants to demonstrate how the ChatGPT system works by building a similar, simpler version that is trained on a small data set known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He wants to show how this system can predict the next character in a sequence based on the patterns it identifies from training data. After training, the system can generate seemingly infinite text that mimics the style of Shakespeare. This is done similarly in ChatGPT, but on a larger scale and with more complexity. He also made all the code he uses available online in his GitHub repository named Nano GPT.
