The speaker is explaining about 'Tiny Shakespeare,' which serves as a training dataset for a language model they are building. 'Tiny Shakespeare' is a file that includes all of the works of William Shakespeare in a single place. Using this dataset allows the AI model to learn language patterns and structure in Shakespeare's works, making it a useful tool for training a character-level language model. This learning exercise helps one understand the workings of sophisticated systems like ChatGPT, a powerful language model that can generate human-like language responses.
