The speaker is describing the way ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model, generates responses. When a user inputs a sequence of text, like a writing prompt, ChatGPT takes this sequence and predicts what comes next based on its training. The completion of the sequence is the outcome, or the generated response, which forms a coherent and contextually valid continuation of the input text. In other words, the speaker provides the starting sequence, and ChatGPT completes the sequence with an outcome.
