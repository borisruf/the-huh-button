The speaker in this explanation is outlining how AI systems like ChatGPT work on a fundamental level. ChatGPT goes character by character, predicting the sequence of words, to generate text in response to a given prompt. In this specific context, the speaker is training the AI on 'Tiny Shakespeare' - a dataset composed of the works of Shakespeare - and using it to generate text that mimics Shakespearean language. The text is produced character by character, trying to predict the next character based on the previous ones, and thereby generate text that looks like it could be written by Shakespeare.
