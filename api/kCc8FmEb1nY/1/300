The speaker is demonstrating how OpenAI's ChatGPT works. When provided with the beginning of a sequence, or prompt, the AI attempts to generate the most likely continuation of that sequence based on the patterns it has learned from vast amounts of text data. These sequences usually come in the form of phrases or sentences. However, for the same starting sequence, it can produce slightly different responses each time because this system is probabilistic, meaning it employs randomness in its decision-making process. This feature allows the AI to generate a broad range of replies to the same input, making the interaction dynamic and unpredictable in some ways.
