The speaker is explaining how the AI language model ChatGPT generates text. ChatGPT operates by getting an input, which is the start of a sequence, usually a sentence or a phrase. Based on this input, the AI draws from its understanding of language patterns to generate a logical continuation of the sequence. It predicts what the next words or phrases should be, effectively 'completing' the sequence. The completion is not always identical, as the AI can provide different yet appropriate responses to the same input. This ability is part of what makes interactions with ChatGPT so dynamic and realistic.
