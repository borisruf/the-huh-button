The speaker in this transcript is discussing a language model based on the Transformer neural network architecture, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which uses a predictive system to generate responses given a text input. However, they are not trying to recreate ChatGPT, but are aiming to train a simple Transformer-based language model using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. They explain that the training involves the model learning to predict what character is likely to come next in a sequence. The goal is to have the AI model generate text that mimics Shakespeare's writing style. By teaching the model on Shakespeare's corpus, it learns all unique patterns within the playwright's language and hence can construct text that resembles his distinctive style.
