The speaker is talking about the workings of GPT, a language model developed by OpenAI and used in tools such as ChatGPT. Specifically, they are discussing a project they embarked on to reproduce and understand the inner workings of GPT, referring to their project as Nano GPT. They've implemented and trained a Transformer-based language model, the kind of neural network that powers GPT, using a dataset called Tiny Shakespeare, which contains all of Shakespeare's works. They've managed to train the model to generate text similar to Shakespeare's style. Looking ahead, they plan to reproduce GPT2, an early version of GPT, using the Open Webtext dataset. As proof of their progress, they have successfully produced the smallest, 124 million parameter model, and have been able to correctly load the neural network weights released by OpenAI.
