The speaker begins by introducing and explaining the capabilities of ChatGPT, an AI 'language model' system that can generate diverse language content based on a given prompt. The speaker emphasizes the probabilistic nature of ChatGPT, which for a single prompt, can provide numerous different answers. They also discuss the system's basis in the Transformer architecture proposed in the 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need".

The speaker then transitions to discussing their goal to build a similar, though less complex, Transformer-based language model. For training purposes, they propose using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which contains the full works of Shakespeare. The aim is to train the model on these sequences of characters such that it can predict what character is likely to come next in a given sequence. The result would be the generation of Shakespeare-like text.

Finally, the speaker presents their already-written code, housed in the 'Nano GPT' repository on GitHub. This code, which trains Transformers on given text datasets, will be used as a base to write a language model from scratch during the lecture. This approach allows for a simpler, more educational understanding of how these systems function.
