This statement is explaining how ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI), functions. The AI is given a sequence, or a prompt, and it generates a completion for that sequence based on its understanding and model of language. It's worth noting that as it is a probabilistic model, it can generate different outcomes each time even with the same prompt. In simple terms, you provide the starter (the prompt) and the AI generates the rest of the content.
