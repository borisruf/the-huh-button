In this section, Andrej is explaining that ChatGPT, the AI system under discussion, is a type of 'language model'. A language model is known as such because it is able to pattern the sequence of words, or other elements such as characters or tokens, in a particular language. In this case, the language is English. Andrej expounds that from the perspective of ChatGPT, what it is essentially doing is completing a sequence. It is provided with the beginning of a sequence, and the task of the AI is to predictably fill in the rest of that sequence to form a sensical, meaningful outcome.
