Andrej is explaining how to build and train a Transformer-based language model using a small toy dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He plans to detail the process from scratch and guide his audience through the process in the context of a Google Colab Jupyter notebook. While acknowledging that proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and familiarity with his previous videos will be beneficial, his aim is to help the audience understand the underlying workings of the GPT or 'generatively pre-trained Transformer', a key component of ChatGPT. He refers to an online repository, 'Nano GPT' available on his GitHub, for example code to train Transformers, but clarifies he will be creating new code for the tutorial.
