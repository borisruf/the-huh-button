Andrej proposes to create a simplified version of ChatGPT to demonstrate how the underlying Transformer model works. He states that building this simpler model will still be educational despite not reproducing the complete functionality of ChatGPT. He plans to build a character-level language model using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, aiming to demonstrate how the model generates sequences character by character that resemble Shakespeare's writing. Andrej mentions he has already written this code and it is stored in his GitHub repository named Nano GPT. He intends to write the repository from scratch in the course of the video to assist in understanding how Chat GPT operates under the hood. His goal is to make viewers understand and appreciate the functioning of the Chat GPT model.
