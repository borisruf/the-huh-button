The character-level language model mentioned here will be trained on a dataset comprising the complete works of Shakespeare. To prepare the dataset, the text will first be converted into a sequence of tokens, or distinct units of meaning. In this case, since the model operates at the character level, each token will be a single character, such as a letter, number, or punctuation mark. 

In order to express these tokens in a form the model can understand, each is assigned a unique integer value. This process, known as tokenization, involves mapping each character to an integer. This language representation form will allow the Transformer architecture powering the model to more easily recognize and learn the patterns in Shakespeare's works. As per the model training, given a sequence of characters, it will predict which character is most likely to come next, thus generating text in a manner similar to Shakespeare's style. 

Essentially, the character-to-integer translation transforms the raw text into a numerical form that the model can process and learn from. It simplifies understanding patterns and relationships between characters, helping the model generate meaningful and coherent text.
