The speaker describes a method for training a Transformer-based language model called ChatGPT. This model is trained to comprehend the context of a sequence of characters and predict likely subsequent characters based on its training. Rather than train on a large dataset like the internet, the speaker suggests using relatively small datasets for simplicity. The dataset used in this case is a compilation of all of William Shakespeare's works. After training, the model should be able to generate text that imitates Shakespeare's writing style.

The speaker explains how the raw text data is transformed for computer processing through a process called tokenization. In this case, they use character-level tokenization, which converts each individual character into a corresponding integer. The range of integers (0-64) forms a "vocabulary" for the model. Other forms of tokenization might break text down into words or even sub-word units, but character-level tokenization keeps it simple.

After tokenizing the text, a tensor (a mathematical object analogous to vectors and matrices, used in machine learning) is created from the sequence of integers. This tensor effectively translates the raw text data into a form that the neural network model can understand and learn from.
