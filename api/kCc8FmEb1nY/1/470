In the last sentence, Andrej plans to lead viewers through the process of constructing a Transformer neural network from scratch. His goal is to help viewers understand the underlying mechanics of the AI chatbot GPT. For this task, he will use Python, with any necessary understanding of calculus and statistics. Additionally, familiarity with his "Make More" series, which introduces language modeling, will be beneficial. The final product will be trained on the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset, offering a simpler and smaller-scale example of how GPT works. Andrej will be using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook for this process, the link to which will be available in the description of the finished video.
