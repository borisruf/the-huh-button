The speaker provides an overview of the capabilities of ChatGPT, emphasizing its ability to generate text in a probabilistic manner based on given prompts. They highlight its underlying 'language model' which knows how words follow each other in the English language. To delve into the technicalities, the speaker explains that ChatGPT is underpinned by the Transformer architecture, proposed in a 2017 paper titled 'Attention is all you need'. They emphasize how this architecture, initially proposed for machine translation, has been widely adopted across a range of AI applications. The speaker's ultimate goal is to train a Transformer-based language model on a small Shakespearean dataset to help viewers understand the workings of these systems. They conclude by indicating the necessary prerequisites for following along, including a proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and familiarity with simpler neural network language models.
