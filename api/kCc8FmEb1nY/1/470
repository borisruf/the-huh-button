The context is discussing how the speaker intends to explain and demonstrate how a Transformer-based language model works. Specifically, the speaker intends to use a text file of all of Shakespeare's works, known as 'Tiny Shakespeare' to model how characters in the text follow each other and predict the next likely character, thereby training a language model.

In the line "here, I open the "input.txt" file and just read in all the text as a string," the speaker has read the entire content of the 'input.txt' file, which is presumably the 'Tiny Shakespeare' text dataset, into memory as one large string of text. This string will be used to create and train the language model.
