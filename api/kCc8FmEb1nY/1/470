The speaker explains how ChatGPT works by using the Transformer architecture, which is a neural network model developed for translation. The speaker also emphasizes that ChatGPT is a language model, which means it understands the sequence and patterns of words in language. The speaker then suggests training a Transformer-based language model using a smaller dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The aim is to predict the next character based on an input sequence of characters from Shakespeare's works. The trained model will then be capable of generating text character by character mimicking Shakespeare's language. The speaker further explained the difference between their model and Chat GPT, where theirs predict character by character and ChatGPT predict token by token.In the given context, the speaker refers to initialising or accessing a file named "input", presumably containing data relevant to the programming or machine learning task being discussed.
