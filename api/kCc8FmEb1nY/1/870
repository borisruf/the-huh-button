The sentence "This file is about one megabyte and it's just all of Shakespeare and what we are going to do now is, we're going to basically model how these characters follow each other" means he's going to use a one-megabyte file that contains the works of Shakespeare to train a model on how the characters (letters and punctuation) in Shakespeare's texts follow one another. This dataset will be used to teach the model the patterns of how a character typically comes next after a series of other characters, which is an approach called language modelling.
