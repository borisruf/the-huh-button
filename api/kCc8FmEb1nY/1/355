The speaker is talking about a feature of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. The process they are referring to is sequence completion where a system takes a given initial sequence (context or prompt) and generates a continuation. The AI model processes the input sequence and then it generates or predicts the next elements in the sequence based on the patterns it has learned from past data. For ChatGPT, these elements are words or phrases in a text. The speaker points out that ChatGPT's outputs may vary for the same prompt, indicating its probabilistic nature.
