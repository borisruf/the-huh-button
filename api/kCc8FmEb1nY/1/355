In this context, the speaker refers to his code in the GitHub repository, Nano GPT, as a "very simple implementation." He likely means that despite the complex and sophisticated nature of Transformer models and GPT (generatively pre-trained Transformer), the framework he has created to train these models is straightforward and easy to understand. Furthermore, it could also mean that compared to much more complex production versions like OpenAI's ChatGPT, his version is simpler and less equipped, but it is still capable of demonstrating how these systems work.
