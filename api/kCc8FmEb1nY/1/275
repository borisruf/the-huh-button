Andrej refers to ChatGPT as a 'language model' as it's able to predict the sequence of words, characters, or tokens, in this context. He explains that when it operates, it tries to complete the sequence, meaning he gives it the beginning of a sequence, and ChatGPT fills in the rest based on its programming and understanding of language patterns.
