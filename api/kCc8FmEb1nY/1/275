The speaker is explaining how they interact with an AI language model like ChatGPT. The model takes an initial input, which the speaker refers to as the 'start of a sequence,' and then generates a continuation or completion of that sequence based on patterns it has learned from its training data. It's like giving the AI a prompt and it generates the rest of the text based on that prompt, all while making it seem like a natural continuation. It can generate multiple different outcomes for the same prompt because it's a probabilistic system, which means it predicts the next word based on the probabilities learned from its training data.
