The speaker is sharing a detailed technical description of a character-level language model. He describes how the model works, how it is trained, and how it can generate text that mimics the style of a given text, in this case, Shakespeare. When he says "46, 47, etc." He is explaining that every character is assigned an integer. He uses characters in an input string "hi there" as an example. These characters are translated into a list of integers, (for example, 46, 47) for further processing by the language model. The corresponding integer values depend on the way characters were encoded, each having a unique numerical representation.
