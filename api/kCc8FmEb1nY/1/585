Andrej is proposing to create a miniature version of ChatGPT using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. While acknowledging that his version won't match the complexity or performance of the real GPT, he believes it will be educational and help viewers understand how the system works. He emphasizes that skills in Python, calculus, and statistics, as well as familiarity with his previous video series, are necessary to follow along. He will use a Google Colab Jupyter notebook to develop the Transformer piece by piece.
