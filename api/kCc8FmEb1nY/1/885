Andrej aims to build a simplified version of the neural network-based language model, known as Chat GPT, utilizing a smaller dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He then intends to model patterns within this dataset, allowing the Transformer neural network to learn the succession of characters and predict subsequent characters in a sequence. Through this process, he envisions generating a continuous Shakespeare-like language output. Also, he plans to share these proceedings through a Google Colab Jupyter notebook while utilizing his previously written script, Nano GPT, which can train Transformers on any text. His ultimate goal is to provide a thorough understanding of how Chat GPT functions at its core.
