The presenter is explaining how the AI system, ChatGPT works. When they say "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome", they're referring to providing a 'prompt' to the AI. This prompt serves as the beginning of a sequence, such as a sentence or a line of text. The AI model then takes this prompt and generates additional text that follows logically or contextually from the prompt. This mechanism allows the AI to produce various types of text, like poetry, prose or even technical explanations, based on the prompts given to it. The 'outcome' the presenter refers to is the piece of text that the AI generates in response to the prompt.
