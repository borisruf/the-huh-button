"Predicting Shakespeare-like language" refers to the process wherein a language model, such as ChatGPT, is trained using a dataset composed entirely of the works of Shakespeare. Once the model has been trained, it can generate character sequences that resemble the syntax, vocabulary, and style typically found in Shakespeare's work. This happens as the model correctly predicts what character or word likely follows a given set of characters based on its training data (i.e., Shakespeare's collection of works). Even though the output might not exactly match Shakespeare's original work, it can resemble his writing style to a reasonable extent.
