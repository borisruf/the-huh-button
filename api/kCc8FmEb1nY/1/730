In this transcript, Andrej discusses the principles behind various machine learning models, including the GPT-2. He explains how they use a Transformer neural network to predict subsequent elements in a sequence. Andrej also emphasizes that these systems learn patterns in the data they're given and apply these learned patterns to make predictions. He introduces a codebase he developed for training Transformers and plans to train one on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset in this session. This Github repository, called Nano GPT, has a simple implementation consisting of two files. Andrej, hence, plans to rebuild this repository in the current session to better illustrate how models like Chat GPT work.
