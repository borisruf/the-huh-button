Andrej is explaining how to build out a smaller version of ChatGPT. He clarifies that it won't be a reproduction of ChatGPT as the latter is a serious, production-grade system trained on a large portion of the internet and involves a complex process of pre-training and fine-tuning. Instead, Andrej's focus will be on training a Transformer-based language model. He plans to use 'Tiny Shakespeare', his favorite toy dataset, to do this. The Transformer neural network will be trained to predict characters in the sequences of data from the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. Andrej wants the audience to appreciate and understand how ChatGPT works from this exercise. He has already written code for training Transformers which can be found on his GitHub repository called 'nanoGPT', but he intends to write this repository from scratch in the video for educational purposes. It's important for the viewer to have some level of proficiency in Python, as well as a basic understanding of calculus and statistics. His existing videos on the YouTube channel can also help in understanding the underlying framework. He is using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook for this exercise because it allows easy code sharing.
