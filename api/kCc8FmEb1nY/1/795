In the mentioned lecture, a character-based language model using Transformer neural networks is being explained and developed. The author uses a simplified version of the pre-training process used by ChatGPT and uses the Tiny Shakespeare data set for training. Initially, the author provides an overview of what ChatGPT is and how it functions. After that, the author mentions the landmark AI paper 'Attention is all you need' from 2017, which proposed the Transformer architecture and forms the backbone of the current AI systems, including ChatGPT and other AI applications. The author emphasizes how this seemingly simple algorithm took over the AI field in the last five years. 

The author explains in detail the process of assigning unique integer "tokens" to each unique character in the input data. This process, called "tokenization", is important because it allows the Transformer model to handle the data in a way that it can understand and learn from. The author discusses various tokenization strategies, but decides to employ a simple character-level tokenization for the purposes of this lecture. 

The lecture continues with the author tokenizing the entire Shakespearean text dataset, wrapping it in a PyTorch tensor, and then proceeding to demonstrate the first 1,000 characters in the tensor. 

This lecture aims at enabling the audience to understand how ChatGPT works in an in-depth manner. The author uses a simplified version of the model to explain complex AI concepts, thereby making the subject approachable to individuals with knowledge primarily in Python, and some basic understanding of calculus and statistics.
