In the lecture's final statement, Andrej explains that he has created a new Google Colab Jupyter notebook to write code in which will allow him to build a Transformer from scratch and train it on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, to generate infinite 'Shakespeare-like' text. He mentions this code will be accessible for the viewers to follow along with in the video description. He is aiming for the viewers to have a better understanding of how 'ChatGPT' works under the hood through this process. It is suggested that viewers have proficiency in Python programming language, basic knowledge of calculus and statistics, and preferably have seen Andrej's previous videos on simpler neural network language models.
