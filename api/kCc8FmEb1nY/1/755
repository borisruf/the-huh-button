The professor says, "torch.tensor" to express that he is going to use the library PyTorch, to convert data into a format that is compatible with his program. This operation will be used to process all the text from a dataset, in this case the 'Tiny Shakespaere' dataset. After applying the encode function on the entire dataset, they'll wrap it into a Pytorch tensor creating a 'data tensor'. This data tensor will then be able to be processed and understood by the AI model they are building, training the model and allowing it to generate outputs.
