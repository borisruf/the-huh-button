The presenter is explaining how a 'character-level tokenizer' is used in the context of training a language model. A tokenizer in natural language processing is a feature that breaks down text into smaller units called tokens, typically words or phrases. However, a character-level tokenizer breaks text into characters instead of words or phrases, which the presenter mentions is simpler than other methods such as the 'sentence piece' by Google or the 'byte pair encoding tokenizer' used by OpenAI. 

The character-level tokenizer transforms each character in the text into a specific numeric value, creating a 'code-book' from which the model learns the sequence of characters. With this approach, there are less tokens (characters as opposed to words or sentences), and the corresponding numeric 'code-book' used by the tokenizer is relatively small. This simplicity allows the system to more easily learn patterns and dependencies within the data.

The vocabulary size of the tokenizer refers to the number of unique tokens it can handle. For a character-level tokenizer, this could be the total number of characters being used, which might be significantly smaller compared to a word or phrase level tokenizer. In the examples shown, there are only 65 unique characters in the dataset's vocabulary.

Despite its simplicity, a character-level tokenizer can successfully be used to train a Transformer-based language model to generate coherent and contextually meaningful sequences, replicating the style and syntax of the original text it was trained on. For example, the given model was trained on Shakespeare's works and can generate Shakespeare-like language.
