In his educational video, Andrej provides an overview of a chatbot called ChatGPT, offering some examples of the bot's ability to respond to prompts creatively and differently each time. Andrej then reveals that ChatGPT is powered by a neural network called Transformer, which uses AI to analyze sequences of words and predict what should naturally come next. He says that this curious technology is implemented in many different AI applications and is at the core of ChatGPT. Andrej points out that replicating ChatGPT would be challenging due to its complexity, but he intends to train a character-level Transformer-based language model using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' in order to demonstrate the dynamics of the system. This model will help the audience understand how to predict sequences and will allow for the generation of mock-Shakespearean text. Lastly, Andrej mentions that he has already developed such a training model, which can be found on his GitHub repository, and his goal during the video is to allow the audience to understand and appreciate how Chat GPT works and demonstrate how to build a model from scratch.
