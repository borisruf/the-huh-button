The speaker has mentioned the term "tokenize the input text," which means using a strategy to break down or segment the input text into individual units or "tokens." Here, tokens represent individual characters, words, or sub-word units in a text. Tokens can be as short as a character or as long as a sentence, depending on the context. Tokenizing text is a standard pre-processing step for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks like translation, topic modeling, etc., as it helps to understand and analyze the structure of the text better. The goal in this context is to create a tokenizer that can convert the raw text data into a format (tokens) understandable by the model.
