Andrej is highlighting the unique capabilities of ChatGPT, a powerful AI system. He underlines that it's a language model which can generate a sequence of words or tokens based on the task assigned to it. For instance, if given the start of a sequence, it is capable of completing the sentence intelligently and creatively. This capacity is heuristically driven by the AI's understanding of how words typically follow each other in the English language.
