A Transformer is an architecture for a neural network, first proposed in a paper called "Attention is All You Need". The Transformer is used to model sequences of data, such as the sequence of words in a text. It was originally designed for machine translation, but has since been used in a wide range of applications in AI, including language models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). In these models, the Transformer takes a sequence of input data and predicts what comes next in the sequence. It does so by learning patterns in the data and using these patterns to make predictions.
