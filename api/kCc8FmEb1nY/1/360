In this context, when you give the start of a sequence to ChatGPT or any AI language model, you're providing a prompt or an initial set of words or phrases. The AI model then uses this as a reference point to generate a continuation of the sequence based on its knowledge of language, learned from its training data. For example, if you start a sequence with "Once upon a time" it could complete the sequence by generating a story. The completion choice will depend on the specific training and abilities of the AI system, in the case of ChatGPT, it chooses the most probable next words based on its previous training on a massive amount of text data.
