The quoted passage suggests that the AI system, ChatGPT, operates by completing a sequence that is primed by an initial input or prompt. The user provides the start of a sequence, such as a sentence or idea, and the AI uses its language model to predict, generate, and complete the sequence in a way that makes linguistic sense. As an attentive and probabilistic system, ChatGPT can produce different completions or outcomes each time it is given the same prompt, reflecting various possibilities within the constraints of the English language.
