In the video, Andrej explains the general function and capabilities of the AI system, ChatGPT. He further discusses the under-the-hood components that power this system, which is primarily driven by a neural network modeling sequence of words, clocked the 'Transformer'. This Transformer is based on a significant AI paper called "Attention is All You Need" published in 2017. ChatGPT's sophistication means it can't be fully reproduced, but Andrej outlines a plan to build a simpler, character-level language model utilizing a smaller dataset, 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He explains that once this model is trained, it can generate text that mimics Shakespeare's writing style. Andrej has already created a GitHub repository called Nano GPT that contains code to train Transformers on any text, and plans to recreate this repository from scratch in the video to help viewers understand how ChatGPT works.
