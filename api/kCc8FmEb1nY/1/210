In this context, "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" refers to providing an initial input or prompt to the ChatGPT language model. This sequence can be the start of a sentence, a question, or any set of words. Upon receiving this, the AI model predicts or generates the rest of the sequence, coming up with a suitable response or completion based on its understanding of language patterns. The 'outcome' here refers to the generated text or response from ChatGPT. This completion of predicted text is done moment by moment, in a left-to-right manner, generating each subsequent word based on the words it has seen so far.
