In this section, the speaker is discussing and describing GPT, a kind of system that uses artificial intelligence to generate human-like text. The speaker is keen to share how such a language model can be built from scratch using a Transformer neural network. They emphasize the probabilistic approach of GPT, which can generate different outputs for the same input text. For the training model, the speaker suggests using the text from Shakespeare's works as an example. The speaker highlights the complexity and sophistication of this kind of system, but also expresses the goal to make it understandable even to those with minimal prior knowledge. The phrase "Here, I open the 'input'" likely refers to the initialization phase, where the speaker is setting up and preparing the model for training.
