Andrej is proposing to train a Transformer-based language model in the video to illustrate how a system like ChatGPT works. Using his favourite toy dataset 'Tiny Shakespeare', which includes all the works of Shakespeare, he aims to model how characters in the text follow each other and generate Shakespearean-style text. The eventual goal is to help viewers understand how ChatGPT works under the hood. His instruction will begin from scratch, piece by piece, defining and training a Transformer on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. This process, Andrej believes, can be replicated with any text dataset available. The prerequisites include proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and an introduction to the language modeling framework provided in his previous YouTube videos. The code developed will be shared through a Google Colab Jupyter notebook.
