The speaker in this context is introducing the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, a language model that generates responses to given prompts in a text-based format. Cases of its use include generating a haiku, explaining HTML in a simplistic manner, creating hypothetical news articles, and more. As it is a probabilistic system, it can provide multiple responses to a single prompt. The technology driving ChatGPT is a type of neural network architecture known as a Transformer, based on the paper "Attention is All You Need". This technology predicts the outcome of a given sequence of words or characters by modeling how these entities follow one another in a given language. The speaker then cites their own creation, a simple implementation of the Transformer called Nano GPT which has been shown to reproduce the performance of GPT-2, a model developed by OpenAI in 2017.
