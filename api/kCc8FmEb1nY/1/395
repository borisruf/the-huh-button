GPT2 is a generative pre-training model developed in 2017 by OpenAI. It is a revised version of the original GPT model from the same company. The model shows a much better understanding of the context of a text, compared to earlier models. The model was developed to train computer programs to understand human language and use it in a manner similar to the way humans do.

The model is based on the Transformer paper, titled "Attention is all you need", which is a groundbreaking work in the field of language models or natural language processing (NLP). This paper was published in 2017, and due to the significance of its findings, it led to the development of the Transformer neural network which essentially 'models' the flow of words or phrases by giving attention to the sequence of words that are most probable to follow a given phrase. This neural network formed the basis for the development of GPT2.

ChatGPT (an advanced model based on GPT2) is an AI model capable of generating unique answers to prompts given to it in the English language. It can handle a wide range of language tasks such as translating text, giving explanations, and even writing poetries, among other things. The diversity and the quality of outputs returned by ChatGPT to the same input is due to the probabilistic nature of the language model.

The 'Nanogpt' mentioned here is a codebase available on GitHub that allows one to train Transformer-based language models on any given text data set. It was created as a simple and effective means to train Transformers and is a relatively easy-to-understand implementation of the complex language model.
