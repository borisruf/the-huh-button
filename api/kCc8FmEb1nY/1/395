The person is explaining how the AI model "ChatGPT" operates. When the user provides an input text (which can be thought of as the 'start of a sequence'), the AI completes the sequence by generating corresponding output text. Since ChatGPT is a language model, it uses its understanding of word order and grammar to generate realistic and appropriate text. However, being a probabilistic system, it can provide different outputs for the same input text, making it quite dynamic and versatile in its responses.
