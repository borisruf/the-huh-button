The speaker is discussing how ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, works. The speaker identifies the key component of ChatGPT as a Transformer neural network that models character and token sequences based on a given dataset. 

The speaker proposes to build a smaller-scale version of ChatGPT using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. By training the Transformer neural network on this smaller dataset, the speaker believes they can create a 'miniature' version of ChatGPT, called 'Nano GPT', that generates text in the style of Shakespeare.

To be able to follow along and understand this process, the speaker suggests it's essential to have a competent understanding of Python programming, and a basic knowledge of calculus and statistics.
