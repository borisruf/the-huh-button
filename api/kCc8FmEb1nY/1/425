Andrej explains that ChatGPT is a system that interacts with an AI based on text inputs. He demonstrates this by giving the AI prompts and the AI generating different responses each time. This is because ChatGPT is a probabilistic system that can give multiple answers to a single prompt. He refers to it as a 'language model' due to its ability to understand the sequence of words, characters, or tokens in the English language. Therefore, when he provides the AI with a prompt, it completes the sequence.
