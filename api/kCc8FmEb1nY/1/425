The speaker is talking about ChatGPT, a language model that can generate text for various tasks. The speaker describes how the model is given a prompt, or the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with a generated outcome. Due to its probabilistic nature, the model can provide different outcomes for the same prompt. This feature has led to a wide range of creative interactions with ChatGPT, such as writing humorous stories or simulating fictional scenarios.
