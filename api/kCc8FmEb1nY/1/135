This phrase "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" refers to the way the language model ChatGPT works. This artificial intelligence system is given an initial prompt, or sequence of words, and its task is to generate a likely continuation of that sequence based on patterns it has learned from vast amounts of text data. In simpler words, you give ChatGPT a starting point in the conversation or a question, and it will generate a response or complete the conversation based on its programmed knowledge.
