The landmark paper "Attention is All You Need" published in 2017 has revolutionized the field of AI and introduced the Transformer architecture. The Transformer model builds on the concept of 'attention' to extract relevant information from different parts of the input data. It forgoes the conventional sequence-aligned recurrent architecture and introduces a more parallelizable and flexible approach to handle sequences, which makes it particularly suitable for language modeling tasks like machine translation and text generation. 

This architecture forms the basis for AI models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformers), used in popular AI systems like ChatGPT. ChatGPT takes in a sequence of words as input or prompt and generates a suitable continuation, making it capable of generating diverse and creative responses to textual prompts. The Transformer model thus enables AI systems like ChatGPT to understand and generate human-like text based on the context provided to it.
