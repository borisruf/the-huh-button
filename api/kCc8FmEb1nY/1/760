In his final statement, Andrej is emphasizing the focus of this video, which is on the Transformer neural network itself. He has created a Google Colab Jupyter notebook and has already done some preliminary work, such as downloading the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. The aim is to show how to recreate an implementation like Chat GPT, starting with an empty file, defining a Transformer bit-by-bit, training it on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, and seeing how it can generate infinite 'Shakespeare' text. This code will be shared in the video description to allow the audience to follow along. The goal, he states, is to help viewers understand and appreciate how Under the Hood Chat GPT works. To understand it well, viewers would ideally have some proficiency in Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics. Existing familiarity with Andrej's previous videos would also be helpful.
