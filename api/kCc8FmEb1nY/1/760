The educator is discussing the tokenization of a text data set. Tokenization is the process of turning input or text into tokens, which are small structures of meaningful data. Here, a character-level tokenizer is being used, so each character (alphabet, space, punctuation symbol) is represented by an integer. Another method mentioned is sentence piece tokenization, which breaks down text into sub-word units. After the data set is tokenized, it's wrapped into a torch.tensor (a multi-dimensional array) to create a data tensor. The educator provides a visual representation of the relationship between individual characters and their corresponding integers. For a hands-on understanding, he is showing how to build the transformation for the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, a small, frequently used dataset composed entirely of Shakespeare's works.
