The statement "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" refers to the way ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence model, uses a text-based prompt to generate a likely extension of the given sequence of words. For instance, if you start a sentence or pose a question, ChatGPT uses its training on a massive amount of text data to generate a continuation or response that fits logically and linguistically with the given input. This response is based on probabilities learned from its training data, explaining why it might produce slightly different outcomes for the same input each time the task is given.
