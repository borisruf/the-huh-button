In this video, Andrej elucidates how the system ChatGPT works, and how it can be trained to produce language by applying the 'Transformer' neural network based on the 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need". He emphasizes that while they will build something similar to ChatGPT, it won't be as complex since ChatGPT is a production-grade system trained on much of the internet. Instead, Andrej proposes training the model on 'Tiny Shakespeare', a compilation of works by Shakespeare that is only a megabyte in size. He shows how the model can then be used to predict the next character in a given sequence. The demonstration also includes Andrej's GitHub repository, 'nano GPT', containing code to train Transformers. Andrej's ultimate goal is for viewers to understand how ChatGPT works, replicating it with any text content using Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics.
