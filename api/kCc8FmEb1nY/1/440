The video is about the 'Transformer neural network', which is the foundation of ChatGPT, an AI that generates human-like text. The speaker explains how the Transformer, proposed in a 2017 paper titled 'Attention is All You Need', has revolutionized AI by providing a blueprint for many applications, including ChatGPT. While the video can't reproduce ChatGPT due to its complexity and intense training on a vast amount of internet data, the speaker intends to train a Transformer-based language model on a smaller dataset - 'Tiny Shakespeare'. After training, the Transformer will predict the next character in the sequence based on the previous context, eventually generating infinite text that mimics Shakespeare's style. The entire process of defining and training a Transformer will be illustrated using Python, with a focus on understanding how ChatGPT works under the hood. The speaker encourages viewers to apply the process to any text dataset they prefer.
