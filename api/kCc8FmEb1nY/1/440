This phrase highlights the working concept of language models like ChatGPT. It means you provide the language model with a beginning (prompt, sequence or command) it understands, and then it generates or 'completes' the rest of the text, based on its learnt knowledge and understanding of language structures. For example, if you tell it â€“ "write a story about a prince named Harry"- it will use that start of a sequence and generate a story revolving around a prince named Harry. Given that GPT models are probabilistic, the outcome or generated text can vary each time you give it the same prompt.
