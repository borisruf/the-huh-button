The architecture mentioned is the Transformer model, which was introduced in a 2017 paper titled "Attention is all you need". The architecture was initially created in the context of machine translation, but due to its innovative structure and effectiveness, it ended up becoming widely used in many different AI applications over the next five years. Particularly in tasks that involve natural language processing and understanding, such as ChatGPT. This is because the Transformer model introduced an approach that replaced recurrence (commonly used in previous models) with a mechanism known as “attention”, enabling it to handle long-term dependencies in text more effectively. Thus, it revolutionized how AI models process and generate text, becoming a key aspect in many AI systems.
