This statement essentially describes how the AI system, ChatGPT, works in processing a prompt given by the user. When the user provides a text prompt, it is like providing the start of a specific sequence. The AI then takes this sequence and generates a completion for it, based on its training on massive amounts of text data. This generated completion depends on the initial sequence given by the user and, importantly, the system's learned understanding of language patterns, flow of thought, and other linguistic characteristics. The generated completion is regarded as the 'outcome'. Hence, for ChatGPT, the task is to 'complete the sequence'. This is done from a probabilistic perspective â€“ the same prompt can result in different outcomes, each time the AI runs.
