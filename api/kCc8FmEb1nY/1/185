"And that includes at the core of Chat GPT" refers to the usage of the "Transformer" AI model within the Chat GPT software. The Transformer model, first proposed in a 2017 research paper called "Attention is All You Need", changed the way AI processed language and has been widely adopted across the field in diverse applications. The author noted this innovation even though its original creators did not fully foresee the impact and wide usage it would eventually have. In the case of Chat GPT, the Transformer model is responsible for processing language and generating responses.
