In the previous sentences, Andrej mentions that he will provide a guided example of creating a language model using the Transformer neural network. The neural network will be trained on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. This model, once trained, will be capable of generating text that appears similar to Shakespeare's literature. After the model is completed, Andrejâ€™s goal is to achieve an understanding of how GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) operates. A prerequisite for this process involves a proficiency in Python and a foundational understanding of calculus and statistics. Prior viewing of Andrej's videos on neural network language models would also be beneficial. Upon completion, he will share the developed code in the video description for others to follow and replicate.
