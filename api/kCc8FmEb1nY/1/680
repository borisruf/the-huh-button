In this context, the narrator describes encoding text for training in an AI language model, specifically a transformer-based language model using the works of Shakespeare. The encoding and decoding process is tokenization, which is translating raw text into a sequence of integers according to a vocabulary of possible elements. Encoding extracts individual characters from a raw text and assigns each an equivalent integer number using the look-up table (encoding dictionary), while decoding converts the integer numbers back to the original raw text. 

However, the narrator brings up Google's 'sentence piece,' stating it uses a different schema and vocabulary. Sentence piece encodes text at a sub-word level, meaning it does not encode entire words as whole tokens nor does it break the words into individual characters. For example, a subword tokenizer might break a word like "butterfly" into smaller pieces or subwords like "butter" and "fly". This approach helps to cope with the complex morphology of some languages like German and also helps to deal with the problem of handling words that were not seen during training.
