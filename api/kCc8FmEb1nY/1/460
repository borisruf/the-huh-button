The phrase "I've just done some preliminaries" in this context refers to the speaker's initial explanations and preparatory work. These preliminaries include introducing ChatGPT, explaining its function as a language model, going over its Transformer architecture, and mentioning the 'Attention is All You Need' paper that created this architecture. The speaker also discussed the notion of training a simple Transformer-based language model using a toy dataset ('Tiny Shakespeare') and has given an idea of what he intends to achieve by the end of the session. The speaker also connected this project to his Nano GPT repository, a codebase for training Transformers. These preparatory remarks were intended to provide adequate context and background information before diving into the main topic.
