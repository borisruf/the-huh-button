The speaker provides background information on an artificial intelligence system, ChatGPT, explaining that it's a probabilistic system that can provide different responses to a prompt, and is considered a 'language model.' The speaker then explains that the functionality of ChatGPT is based on a neural network model known as ‘Transformer’, proposed in a 2017 paper called 'Attention is all you need.' 

The speaker intends to demonstrate how to build and train a Transformer-based, character-level language model using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare,' which contains all of Shakespeare's works. The goal is to have the model generate passages of text that resemble Shakespeare's style. 

The speaker also highlights a GitHub repository called Nano GPT, which contains code for training Transformers. The speaker's objective is to explain the inner workings of GPT models and provide a step-by-step process for building and training these models. The speaker suggests it would be helpful if the audience had a basic understanding of Python, calculus, and statistics, and had watched their prior videos on the respective YouTube channel.
