The speaker is explaining how AI systems, specifically ChatGPT, generate text based on a sequence of words or characters given to it. In simple terms, you provide the system with a starting point or prompt. The AI system then uses its understanding of language, context, and probabilities to generate a logical continuation or completion of the given sequence. The speaker emphasizes that the AI doesn't provide a single deterministic answer but can offer multiple potential responses based on the probabilities it calculates, showing a degree of creativity and adaptability.
