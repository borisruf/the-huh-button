"Encoding" or "tokenizing" in AI language models refers to the process of converting raw text into a sequence of integers that represent certain elements of a vocabulary. A vocabulary here can refer to different units of language, such as characters, words, or phrases. 

In the example provided, a character-level encoding is utilized, where each unique character in the text is mapped to a unique integer. For instance, the phrase "hi there" is translated into a list of integers, where each integer represents the corresponding character in the string. The mapping is not arbitrary but based on a specific lookup table that the model creates, mapping each unique character to a unique integer.

The reverse process of converting these integers back into characters is called decoding. This is why two functions are created: an encoder to map the characters to integers, and a decoder to map the integers back to characters.

The character-level encoding/tokenization is simply one of the many methods of encoding. More complex methods could involve tokenizing words or even entire phrases.

The purpose of such encoding/decoding is to convert human-readable text into a format that the AI model can process and understand.
