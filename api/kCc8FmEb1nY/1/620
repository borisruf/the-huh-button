The "reverse mapping" in this context refers to a function or process that converts a series of integers back into text. This process is implemented in machine learning and natural language processing tasks to convert the results from a language model, often encoded as integers or tokens, back into understandable text. In other words, while the encoder changes the text into a format that the machine can understand and learn from, the reverse mapping or decoder returns the machine's output back into a human-readable format. Here, it is used to decode the output from the Transformer language model that is being trained on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
