Andrej's intention in this video is to provide an educational look at how language models such as Chat GPT work. Despite recognizing that replicating Chat GPT is too complex for the tutorial, his plan is to train a Transformer-based character-level language model on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset and generate text that mimics Shakespeare's style of writing. His goal is to demystify the underlying workings of Chat GPT and help viewers appreciate its intricacies. His approach, called Nano GPT, is straightforward and he encourages viewers to use the same steps to train Transformers using any text dataset of their choosing.
