The term "open the 'input" probably refers to the author opening an input file for use in a coding sample. This is likely where data is being loaded into a program, as the speaker mentioned downloading a dataset from a URL. In this context, the 'input' is presumably a file name or file descriptor representing the downloaded Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
