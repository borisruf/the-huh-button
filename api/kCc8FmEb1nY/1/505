This phrase is referring to how the set constructor in Python works. In Python, a set is a built-in data type that holds an unordered collection of unique elements. The set constructor is a function that generates a new set out of a sequence, such as a list or a string. When applied to a string, the set constructor will return a set with all the unique characters that appear in that string. 

As per the context, the speaker is using the set constructor on a large text file containing several works of Shakespeare. By calling the set constructor, all the unique characters in this dataset can be captured. This helps in understanding the character set of the language used in these texts, which in turn can assist in the training of a language model like GPT.
