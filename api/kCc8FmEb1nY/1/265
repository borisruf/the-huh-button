The extract provides a discussion about the capabilities of ChatGPT, a text-based conversational artificial intelligence (AI), and its underlying AI model, Transformer. By inputting a sequence of characters, users could prompt ChatGPT to complete tasks such as writing poems, explaining complex concepts in a simple manner, or creating humorous texts.

Transformer, the AI model powering ChatGPT, is efficient in predicting the sequence of words and understanding how they follow each other in a given context. Thus, the AI translator was designed to generate texts that align with the context and linguistic rules of English language. 

The text concludes with the author's plan to use a smaller dataset called Tiny Shakespeare - a file containing all of Shakespeare's works - to build a simpler version of a Transformer-based language model. This model will predict the sequence of characters in the given context.
