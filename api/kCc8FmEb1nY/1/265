In the context mentioned, a sequence refers to a series of words or sentences that serve as a prompt for the AI system, ChatGPT. When the user says, "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome", it implies that the user provides an initiating text or instruction (for example, a phrase, a question, a small piece of text), and ChatGPT continues and expands upon that initial prompt to generate a coherent and contextually relevant textual outputâ€”essentially, completing the sequence. The 'outcome' represents the text that the AI model generates in response to the given prompt. The entire process is underpinned by sophisticated algorithms and data models, which enable the AI to follow the provided 'sequence' of words and generate a meaningful, relevant completion or 'outcome'.
