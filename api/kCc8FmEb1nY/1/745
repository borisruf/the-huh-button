A tensor from the PyTorch library is a multi-dimensional matrix containing elements of a single data type. It is similar to NumPy's ndarrays but with the capability to use GPU to accelerate computing if available. Tensors are used as a fundamental data structure in PyTorch to process and handle data in machine learning and deep learning tasks. They support various mathematical operations similar to those used in machine learning algorithms. This makes tensors essential in ML tasks as these operations can be completed more efficiently in a GPU.
