Andrej is further explaining the workings of the Transformer neural network, which is used to model the sequence of words. He gives an example of training the model on 'Tiny Shakespeare', a dataset comprising all the works of Shakespeare. Once the system is trained, it is able to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's language in structure and style. Andrej has written code to train these transformers, which can be found in his GitHub repository called Nano GPT. He invites viewers to follow along as he writes the code from scratch, with the intention of helping them understand how systems like Chat GPT work under the hood. A fundamental understanding of Python, calculus, and statistics is helpful for following the process. Lastly, he mentions creating a new Google Colab Jupyter notebook for clear code sharing.
