A language model is an AI system that is trained to understand and generate sequences of words, characters, or tokens, based on given input. The model essentially makes predictions for a specific sentence or text by determining the probability of a word or a sequence of words appearing next, based on the ones that have appeared before. It aids in various tasks like generating text, such as the examples given in the context with ChatGPT, making the AI appear as a human text generator.
