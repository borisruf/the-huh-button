A 'language model' refers to a type of Artificial Intelligence model that has been trained to understand, predict, and generate language. This model operates by assigning probabilities to the sequence of words, characters, or tokens(in computational linguistics, a token is an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing). The aim is to predict the next word, character, or token in a sequence based on the previous ones. For example, the AI ChatGPT mentioned in the context, generates answers to prompts by predicting the sequence of words that should come next, based on the input and its training data. This capability allows it to generate comprehensive and meaningful sentences.
