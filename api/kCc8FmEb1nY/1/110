The mentioned phrase refers to the operation of the ChatGPT AI system. When given a text-based task or a prompt, it 'completes the sequence'. This means it reads the text (input) provided in a left-to-right sequence, anticipates what comes next based on what it has learned during its training, and generates the next words or sentences accordingly. The AI is built to predict the probability of the next word in a sentence given all the previous words, hence completing the 'sequence'. This predictive behavior enables it to generate diverse and creative outputs in response to a given prompt, such as the different answers or examples provided in the context.
