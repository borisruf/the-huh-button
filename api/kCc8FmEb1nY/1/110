The specific phrase "From its perspective, what it is doing is completing the sequence" essentially explains the main functionality of ChatGPT from the chatbot's viewpoint. When users provide it with a prompt or an input (which is a sequence of words), ChatGPT attempts to complete or continue this sequence based on the patterns it has learned from its training data. This could involve generating responses, writing articles, or even composing poetry. By 'completing the sequence', ChatGPT generates a text that it predicts would most likely follow the given input, considering the common patterns and contexts in the language model it was trained on.
