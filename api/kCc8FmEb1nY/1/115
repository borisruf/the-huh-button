In this context, "completing the sequence" refers to how the AI language model, ChatGPT, generates text. It starts with a given prompt and sequentially generates the next likely words or tokens based on its training. It 'completes' the sequence of words by predicting and adding the next words that follow logically and grammatically from the initial prompt until the task is completed. This is done based on patterns and probabilities it has learned from its training data.
