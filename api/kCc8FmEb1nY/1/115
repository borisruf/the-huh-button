This statement is a simplified explanation of how language models like ChatGPT function. Language models are trained on sequences of words, characters, etc., and their goal is to predict the next item in a sequence given the previous ones. Hence, when you provide a starting sequence (a prompt), such as "Please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree", ChatGPT will attempt to complete the rest of the sequence in a way that is both semantically and grammatically correct. In this context, the "outcome" refers to the generated text that follows the provided prompt.
