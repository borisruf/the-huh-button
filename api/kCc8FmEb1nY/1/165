ChatGPT is an AI language model that generates text based on a given prompt. It is described as a 'sequence completion' model because it continues a sequence of text from a given starting point. So if you provide the AI with the start of a sentence, paragraph or any given text, it continues from there and completes the text based on the pattern of the given input. However, being a probabilistic system, it can generate slightly different outcomes from the same prompt, thus it can provide multiple responses to the same input. It's used to perform tasks such as writing poems, essays, news articles or explanations on various topics, based on the prompts given.
