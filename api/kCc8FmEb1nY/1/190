The speaker is expressing an interest in building a system like ChatGPT. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a conversational AI model that can generate human-like text responses to a given prompt. The speaker detailed examples of the kind of prompts that ChatGPT can handle and pointed out that it is a probabilistic system, meaning it can generate multiple responses to the same prompt. 

The speaker then shifts to discussing the the underlying principle of how ChatGPT operates. ChatGPT is based on the Transformer architecture from a 2017 paper, "Attention is All You Need". Although the paper was originally about machine translation, the Transformer architecture it proposed has been widely adopted in AI applications. The speaker plans to build something akin to ChatGPT, presumably using the Transformer architecture as the core engine.
