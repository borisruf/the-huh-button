This statement is a simplification of how ChatGPT works. In essence, the user provides an initial set of characters or words (the start of a sequence), and the model predicts what comes next to complete it. This prediction is based on patterns it has learnt from the massive amount of text data it was trained on. For every word, it considers the likelihood of every possible next word (hence the probabilistic nature mentioned), and selects one based on these probabilities. It does this sequentially for each next word until it completes the task. However, as is clear from the different responses to the same prompt, the system allows for a degree of randomness, so it won't always produce the same sequence each time you run it with the same input.
