The speaker is explaining that they will be building a simple, educational version of the AI language model ChatGPT, using a Transformer-based model to generate a character-level language model. Here, 'character by character' refers to how this model will predict the next 'character' in a sequence based on the context of characters that came before it. They are planning to use the Shakespeare dataset to train this model, and aim to have it output text that somewhat resembles Shakespeare's writing, character by character.
