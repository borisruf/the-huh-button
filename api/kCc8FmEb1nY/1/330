The speaker is using the phrase "work chunk level" to describe the way the AI system, GPT, processes text data. Instead of processing and generating text at the word level (i.e., one word at a time), it does so at the "work chunk level", where "work chunks" or "tokens" are often portions of words or several words lumped together. This characteristic enables the Transformer model (that ChatGPT uses) to better understand the context and relationships between words in a sequence, thus improving its performance in natural language processing tasks.
