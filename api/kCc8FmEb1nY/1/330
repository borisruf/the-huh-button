The speaker is describing how ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, works. When you input a prompt or a start of a sequence into ChatGPT, it will generate a response or continue the sequence based on patterns and structures it has learned from a massive amount of text in English language. It does not always produce the exact same outcome for a given prompt because it's probabilistic, meaning it estimates the likelihood of each possible next word and chooses one based on those probabilities.
