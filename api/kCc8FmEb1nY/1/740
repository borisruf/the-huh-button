The phrase, "They are between 0 and 50,256" is related to tokenization, which is the process of converting raw text into sequences of integers according to a predetermined vocabulary of possible elements. In this context, the speaker is discussing an encoding scheme used by OpenAI's library, "tick token". Unlike the simple character level model previously discussed, this uses a 'pipe pair encoding tokenizer'. This tokenizer has a broader range of potential tokens - 50,256. When it encodes the phrase "High there", it results in a list of just three integers, but these integers can fall anywhere within the range of 0 to 50,256. The high upper limit is because the tokenizer operates on a sub-word level, rather than individual characters, giving a more granular representation of the text.
