In the PyTorch library, a Tensor is essentially the fundamental data structure where all operations are performed. Like an array in NumPy, a Tensor provides a multi-dimensional matrix of a single data type. Tensors in PyTorch, however, are built for deep learning and can be utilized to carry out operations on a GPU, which is crucial for speeding up tasks in machine learning models. Tensors are also optimized for automatic differentiation and gradients, essential elements in backpropagation.
