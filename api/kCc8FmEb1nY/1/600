The speaker here is about to create something that resembles the technology used by Chat GPT, an AI language modeling system, but will be working with a less complex dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. In this context, when they mention, "Here, I open the 'input", they're referring to starting the process of loading the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. The dataset, under the guise of 'input', would be fed into the model that they are going to create. The purpose of opening the "input" is to introduce the system to the language style and pattern, thereby training it to craft sentences that mirror those of Shakespeare.
