The presenter has taken viewers through the process of developing a language model akin to OpenAI's GPT, albeit at a much smaller scale. He has defined the terms he plans to use, the scope of the project, and what components will be used, such as Transformers from a landmark AI paper called 'Attention is all you need.' He also discusses what a language model is, how GPT generates responses to prompts, and what type of dataset he will use for this project (in this case, Shakespeare's collective works). The speaker then talks about the data preprocessing steps, including tokenizing and encoding the text into a numerical format that can be processed by the Transformer neural network. He informs viewers that even though the original GPT model was trained on internet data and is complicated, he is focusing on the Transformer part used in the model which he aims to demonstrate using a toy dataset for it to be easily understandable.
