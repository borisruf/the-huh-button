The phrase "For us, it is done on a character level" means that in the given context, the speaker is working with or processing data by individual characters, rather than tokens, chunks, or word level. In the case of this AI model, they're turning individual characters into integers (known as "tokenizing"), rather than processing words or other language structures. This is part of building a character-level language model that can make predictions based on sequences or patterns of characters.
