The speaker in the text is discussing how to develop and train a Transformer-style language model from scratch, similar to the ones used in powerful AI apps like GPT-3. The model that will be developed is based on the research paper 'Attention is All You Need', and will be trained on a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which features the collective works of Shakespeare. The language model will generate its own 'Shakespeare-like' writing by analyzing patterns in the training data and predicting what character would occur next in a sequence. However, the speaker mentions that the model being created won't be as complex as tools like ChatGPT, but it's educational in providing a basic understanding of how these tools work.
