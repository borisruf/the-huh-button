The neural network under the hood that models the sequence of words in ChatGPT is a Transformer-based network, more specifically called the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). This model is trained on a large amount of text data and learns to predict the next word in a sequence based on the context provided by the preceding words. The transformer architecture allows it to take into account long-range dependencies between words and complex syntactic structures. This ability to capture and generate language patterns makes it effective at tasks including not just text generation, but also translation, summarization, and more.
