This phrase refers to how language models, like ChatGPT, function. ChatGPT is a machine learning algorithm that's trained to predict and generate text. When you give this AI a input, which can be thought of as the start of a sequence, ChatGPT uses its understanding of language patterns to generate or "complete" the rest of the sequence - that is, it outputs a likely continuation of the text provided based on its learning. This can result in varying outcomes depending on the probabilistic nature of the AI, as it can offer multiple plausible continuations for a given input.
