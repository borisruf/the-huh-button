A language model is a system used in machine learning and artificial intelligence that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words. It is trained on large amounts of text data to understand not just individual words, but the probability of what words or phrases come next in a sequence. In the context used, ChatGPT is a language model that can generate text based on a given prompt, it completes the sequence by generating the most likely next words. It is "a language model" because it 'models' or represents the language in a way that understands the structure and rules of the language. The fact that it can generate different outputs (albeit similar) for the same prompt indicates its probabilistic nature.
