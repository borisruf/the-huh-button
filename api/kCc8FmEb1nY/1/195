This statement refers to the process in which GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models work, used in AI applications like ChatGPT. The user provides an initial string of text (the start of a sequence), and the AI model predicts and generates the next parts of the sequence (the outcome) based on its pre-trained understanding of the language. This outcome or reply from the AI isn't deterministic but probabilistic, meaning it can generate various answers for the same prompt, driven by the inherent randomness in the process. The whole process mimics the way humans often complete sentences or thoughts started by others.
