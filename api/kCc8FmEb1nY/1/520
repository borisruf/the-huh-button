In the context provided, the phrase "These are the possible elements of our sequences" refers to the unique characters that occur in the input text. In this case, the input text is the entire works of Shakespeare. The aim is to create a language model that predicts the next character based on previous ones. Hence, the "possible elements of the sequences" refers to the potential characters that the AI could predict as the next character in a sequence. The machine learning model will be trained on these unique characters, or vocabulary, to understand the pattern of how these elements follow each other in the sequence of the English language.
