In this context, the pattern or 'sequence' refers to the starting string of text or 'prompt' that is fed to the AI model for processing. The model, ChatGPT, is trained to understand the nature of the prompt and generate a logical continuation or 'completion' of the starting sequence, based on patterns it has learned from vast amounts of English language data. For example, if the initial sequence is "Please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree", ChatGPT will generate a continuation of that sequence which makes sense in English language and suits the context, much like the dramatic article about the fallen leaf. However, this is a probabilistic system, meaning the exact same initial sequence could result in slightly different outcomes each time it's processed.
