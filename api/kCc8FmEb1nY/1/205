This speaker is providing an introduction to ChatGPT, an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that utilizes a language model to complete given prompts with generated text. The speaker uses humorous examples to illustrate the breadth and diversity of possible prompts and responses from ChatGPT, then gives a basic explanation of how it works, emphasizing that it models sequences of words like completing a sentence.

The speaker also highlights the significance of the paper "Attention is All You Need", which introduced the Transformer architecture, a core component of the language model. They explain how the Transformer architecture has since been applied in a range of AI applications.

Finally, they express their intention to focus on training a Transformer-based language model. They acknowledge that while they wonâ€™t be able to replicate ChatGPT entirely due to its complexity and the amount of training and tuning required, they want to offer an introduction to the topic.
