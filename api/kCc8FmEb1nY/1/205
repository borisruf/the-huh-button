The speaker is referring to how a language model operates in terms of generating text. When the presenter inputs a specific prompt or start of a sequence (e.g., "explain HTML to me like I'm a dog"), ChatGPT (a language model developed by OpenAI) responds by generating the rest of the sequence. It follows the pattern and structure of the English language to produce a coherent and logical completion. Therefore, even though the prompt is the same, the result may vary each time as the AI model uses a probabilistic system to generate the outcome.
