A "very serious production-grade system" suggests that ChatGPT is a highly developed, robust, and reliable system built to be used at scale for various practical applications. It means that ChatGPT is not a simple experimental model but an advanced system that undergoes rigorous testing and refinement to handle large-scale workloads, ensuring a high level of performance and uptime. Such a system is often supported by a professional team who maintains it, ensures its security, operation stability, and continuously optimizes its performance. In short, a production-grade system is fully developed and ready for end users. Given this, reproducing ChatGPT would require extensive resources and expertise.
