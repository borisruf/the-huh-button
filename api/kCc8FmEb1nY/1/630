The speaker is working with a language model and needs to convert raw text into a format the model can understand. To do this, they use a technique called tokenization, which involves translating individual characters into integers. This process generates an encoder, which translates a string of raw text into a list of integers, and a decoder, which translates the list of integers back into the original string. The tokenization is done at a character level, meaning each character in a string is individually translated into an integer.
