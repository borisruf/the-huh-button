Andrej gives a detailed explanation of how the neural network model – the Transformer – works, underlying the functionality of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). This model, proposed in a 2017 paper titled "Attention is All You Need", has notably influenced the field of AI over the years, including its core use in Chat GPT. Despite being initially designed for machine translation, the Transformer architecture has been adapted to a wide array of AI applications. Andrej provides an overview of how to use Shakespeare's works (referred to as 'Tiny Shakespeare') as an example of training a Transformer-based character-level language model. Essentially, the characters in the Shakespeare data set act as a training sequence the model learns from. As a result, it is then able to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's style. Further, Andrej mentions his GitHub repository, Nano GPT, which simplifies Transformer training and proves the system's accuracy by replicating the performance of GPT-2. Lastly, he expresses his intent to write this repository from scratch in a follow-on video, aiming to help viewers understand how Chat GPT operates under the hood.
