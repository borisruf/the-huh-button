This passage describes the capabilities of a language model like ChatGPT, which uses AI to generate realistic and appropriate text based on the task assigned to it. This is achieved by the model analyzing how words or characters follow each other in a string of text. The author then suggests they will use a Transformer-based model to train a system on a smaller dataset, the 'Tiny Shakespeare' file. This file contains all of Shakespeare's works. The aim is to use this data to model how characters in this dataset follow each other, essentially teaching the AI to write like Shakespeare.
