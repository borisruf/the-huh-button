The video presenter, Andrej, is explaining how ChatGPT, a language model AI system, works. He states that the AI is essentially completing given sequences. He starts a sequence or prompt, and ChatGPT completes it. It goes from left to right, generating words one after the other. It can respond to the same prompt with different modelled sequences, which are based on the probability of how words follow each other in the English language.
