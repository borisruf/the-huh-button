In this context, giving the AI the start of a sequence refers to providing it with an initial segment of text, or a "prompt." This prompt serves as an input that the AI uses to generate a continuation or completion of the text sequence. For example, if the prompt is "Please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree", the AI will generate words that logically and coherently follow from this start of the sequence, producing a complete "story," like a news article in this case. Since the AI (ChatGPT, in this context) is a probabilistic model, it can generate different yet logically consistent completions for the same input prompt.
