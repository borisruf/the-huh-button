The statement "all of Shakespeare in a single file" refers to having the complete text of all of Shakespeare's works, including plays, sonnets, etc., in one consolidated text file. In this context, this file is being used as a training dataset for an AI language model. Rather than using a larger or more diverse dataset (like a large portion of the internet), the presenter is proposing to use this single, consolidated file of Shakespeare's works as a simpler and more manageable dataset for training the model.
