With this sentence, Andrej is saying that the original paper about the 'Transformer' model, which is the underlying system for the ChatGPT AI, was written as a simple machine translation article. Andrej suggests that the authors likely did not realize the profound impact their Transformer model would have on the entire field of AI. After it was introduced, Andrej explains this model was integrated into a significant number of AI applications with minor alterations. This led to not only the proliferation of the model across a broad range of AI applications but was also fundamentally used in the core operation of systems like ChatGPT.
