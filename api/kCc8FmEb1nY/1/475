In the context mentioned, the speaker is describing the process for training a Transformer-based language model using a small dataset, referred to as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The speaker aims to demonstrate the workings of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), which is a language model typically used to generate human-like text. In an effort to simplify their demonstration, the speaker mentions that instead of training on a large chunk of the internet (the way it's done for GPT), they'll be using a smaller text file containing the works of Shakespeare. This file contains roughly 1 million characters, which is a convenient and manageable size for the purpose of their demonstration. The speaker specifies that they'll be working with a character-level language model, which means the model will learn and predict one character at a time based on a given sequence of previous characters.
