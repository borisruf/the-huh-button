This passage is an in-depth introduction to language modeling in machine learning, specifically focusing on the Transformer neural network used by ChatGPT. The speaker gives examples of how ChatGPT generates realistic responses in natural, human-like language based on prompts, using an underlying algorithm that anticipates the sequence of words or characters. They also mention their goal of training a character-level language model based on Shakespeareâ€™s works, using their special implementation of smaller and simpler neural networks named 'Nano GPT'. The aim is to build a clearer understanding of how ChatGPT and similar AI models work.
