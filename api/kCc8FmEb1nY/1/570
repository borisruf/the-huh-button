The speaker explains that the model in question has a set vocabulary, which are all the characters that appear in its training data. The vocabulary is used to predict future characters based on an input sequence of characters. The speaker uses the works of Shakespeare as an example, training the model to predict that after a certain sequence of characters, a 'g' is likely to come next. This system is said to be able to generate text that appears as if it was written by Shakespeare himself. The term 'vocabulary' in this context is used to signify all the characters that the model has been trained on and can potentially use to generate its own sequences of text.
