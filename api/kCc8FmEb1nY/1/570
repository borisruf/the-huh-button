In this passage, the speaker explains the concept of AI and gives a broad explanation of OpenAI's ChatGPT system. They mention that it is capable of generating human-like text in response to different prompts. The author then goes on to talk about the 'Transformer' architecture that powers the ChatGPT system.

The speaker then discusses creating a simplified version of the ChatGPT system using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset instead of the entire internet. This simplified system would be able to predict the next character in a sequence, based on the characters it had been given, effectively replicating how a character sequence would appear in Shakespeare's works. 

They also mention that they've already developed and published the code for training these "Transformers" in a GitHub repository called NanoGPT.

The speaker then explains how they'll be using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook to develop new code for the Transformer and subsequently train it on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. The speaker finishes the statement by saying, "Here, I open the "input"", which suggests they are about to start with the input data in the following coding session.
