In the last sentence of the transcript, Andrej shares some preliminary actions he has taken in preparation for the coding demonstration. He has set up a Google Colab Jupyter notebook, which will allow him to share the code he will develop for easier following along. This notebook will be available in the video description later. He has also downloaded the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset from a specified URL. Upon opening the file 'input.txt', he shows the first thousand characters of the Shakespearian text. The text can be seen displaying Shakespearian language and is set to serve as the training data for the Transformer-based language model he is about to develop.
