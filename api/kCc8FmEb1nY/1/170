The speaker explains that the Transformer architecture, which had originally been proposed in a 2017 paper titled "Attention is All You Need," revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Initially, it was developed in the context of machine translation to improve the accuracy and efficiency of translating text from one language to another. However, the unique design of the Transformer architecture, which allows for more complex and adaptive model learning, made it versatile enough to be adopted by various other applications within AI, such as natural language processing (NLP), image recognition,and text generation, effectively taking over the rest of AI in the next five years following its introduction. Chat GPT, for example, leverages the Transformer architecture to generate human-like text based on given prompts or tasks incrementally and sequentially.
