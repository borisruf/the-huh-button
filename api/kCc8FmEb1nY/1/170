Andrej highlights that ChatGPT is a language model, capable of generating sequences of words, or tokens, that appropriately follow each other in English. When provided with the start of a sequence, the AI system completes it, producing a coherent output. ChatGPT is impressively adept at this task, demonstrating knowledge of how words relate to each other in the English language and accurately generating the sequel to the given input.
