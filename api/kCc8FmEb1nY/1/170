This statement is referring to how ChatGPT, a language model or AI, operates. The user provides an initial sequence, which can be a sentence or a couple of words, and the model uses this information to generate a continuation or completion of that sequence. This can be used for various tasks ranging from writing haikus to explaining complex concepts in simplified terms. Since it operates on a probability-based system, the responses to the same prompt can vary, exhibiting the impressive flexibility and creativity of the AI.
