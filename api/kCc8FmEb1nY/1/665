The speaker is discussing how ChatGPT, an AI language model, works. They mention that it is a probabilistic system, capable of generating multiple responses to a given prompt. The speaker then delves into the architecture of this AI, the 'Transformer', which was proposed in a landmark AI paper, "Attention is All You Need."

GPT, or 'generatively pre-trained Transformer', is the underlying neural network that handles the language processing task. The paper introduced this architecture for machine translation but it became a key component for many AI applications, including ChatGPT.

The speaker emphasizes that they won't be duplicating the complexity of ChatGPT but will try to educate the audience on how a simpler Transformer-based language model works. They plan to use a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' to model how characters follow each other. They will train the Transformer to predict which character is likely to come next in a sequence. This will enable it to generate pseudo-Shakespearean text.

Finally, they describe how to tokenize text, converting it from raw strings into sequences of integers according to a defined vocabulary, using both an encoder and decoder. They mention that this is only one of many possible methods, mentioning Google's 'sentence piece' and OpenAI's 'Tick Token' as alternative tokenization systems.
