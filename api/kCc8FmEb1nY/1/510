This line of code creates a list of unique characters in the text, in alphabetical order. The 'set' function is first used to get the unique values of a sequence, then 'list' is called to convert this set to a list that has a specific order that can be referenced. Lastly, 'sort' is used to arrange these characters alphabetically. This is done to create a reference for future encoding and decoding steps in the model. Each character in the text will be represented as an integer based on its position in this sorted list of unique characters. Essentially, this code is creating a mapping from the characters in the text to unique integers.
