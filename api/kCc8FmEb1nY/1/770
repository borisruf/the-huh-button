The phrase "Here, I open the 'input." refers to the speaker referring to a process where they are opening a file named 'input', which is presumably loaded with the Tiny Shakespeare dataset mentioned earlier. In this context, it appears like they will access or read this file for use in their program or scripts, specifically to train their Transformer neural network model on this given text dataset. This process is likely a part of data preparation, a crucial step in machine learning and AI, where data is collected, cleaned, processed and transformed into a format that the model can understand and learn from. The Tiny Shakespeare dataset will be used to teach the model language patterns within Shakespeare's work.
