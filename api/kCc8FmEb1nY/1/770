Andrej is intending to demonstrate how the ChatGPT works by building a smaller, simplified version of it using Python. He will be training this model on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which contains all of the works of Shakespeare. His goal is for the model to predict what character in the sequence comes next based on the previous ones. Andrej explains that he has already coded this demonstration and the codes can be found on his GitHub repository called Nano GPT. His objective is to help viewers understand the inner workings of Chat GPT. Andrej hopes this could be replicated with any other text dataset according to the viewer's interest. To follow along his process, one needs proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus, and statistics. Prior viewing of Andrej's previous videos about simpler neural network language models could be useful to gain introductory knowledge of the language modeling framework. In the coming portion of the video, Andrej will focus on building the Transformer neural network.
