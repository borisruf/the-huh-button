The speaker is explaining the creation of a language model using a Transformer (a type of neural network architecture) trained on a small data set of William Shakespeare's works. In his demonstration, he uses character-level tokenization, converting each character of the text into an integer. A sequence of these integers is then used as inputs to train the model, known as a sequence of tokens. As per his example, due to the character-level approach, the result is very long sequences of integers with a small vocabulary of possible tokens. He contrasts this with other tokenization methods such as sub-word or word-level, which results in shorter sequences with larger vocabularies.
