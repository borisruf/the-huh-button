This is discussing the concept of a generative language model, specifically a Transformer architecture used by GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), a kind of AI chatbot. The speaker is intending to train a simplified version of something like ChatGPT. Instead of using a huge dataset like the entire internet, they will train a smaller, character-level language model using the text of Shakespeare's works (called "Tiny Shakespeare"), which is about one megabyte of text.

The model's job is to predict the next character in a sequence based on the previous characters given. Once the model is trained, it should be able to generate text that imitates Shakespeare's style. The speaker mentions using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook for coding and that their code for a simple implementation of a Transformer is available already on GitHub for reference.

The 'first 1000 characters' mentioned at the end refers to the first 1000 characters of the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. When printed, these characters reflect typical sentences from Shakespeare's works. In this context, 'characters' refers to individual letters, numbers, or special characters in a piece of text.
