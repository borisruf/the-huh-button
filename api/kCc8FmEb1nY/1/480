The speaker is discussing training a character-level language model using Google Colab's Jupyter Notebook environment. The goal is to generate text that resembles the works of Shakespeare. Rather than training this model on a large section of the internet like the GPT model developed by OpenAI, the speaker is targeting a much smaller dataset known as "Tiny Shakespeare," which is essentially a concatenation of all of Shakespeare's works in one file. The Transformer neural network model will be trained on this data, learning the patterns and structure of the text in order to predict what character comes next in a sequence. The ultimate goal is to illuminate the methods by which models like ChatGPT function and to teach the audience how to build a basic version themselves.
