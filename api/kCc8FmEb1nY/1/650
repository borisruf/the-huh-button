The speaker has provided an overview of ChatGPT, a text generator powered by an artificial intelligence system. They highlight that it is a probabilistic model, suggesting theoretically infinite unique responses for each input. They go in-depth about its underlying architecture - the transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need". The transformer model, which forms the neural network of ChatGPT, was initially developed for machine translation but has become the go-to for a myriad of AI applications.

The speaker also reveals their desire to train a Transformer-based language model on a smaller dataset for educational purposes, intending to use the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. They outline their plans to deploy a Transformer neural network that predicts character sequences, mimicking Shakespeare's language style. The speaker also introduces an encoding and decoding process used to convert characters into integers and vice versa. They clarify that this is a simplistic representation of tokenization schemas used in practice, where advanced tokenizers like Googleâ€™s Sentence Piece and OpenAI's TickToken are used.
