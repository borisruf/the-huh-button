In this text, the author first discusses the capabilities and functions of ChatGPT, an AI system used for various text-based tasks, including generating responses to prompts in a way similar to how humans would. 

The author then moves on to discuss their intention to create a simple language model based on the Transformer neural network, the architecture underlying ChatGPT. They will use the Tiny Shakespeare dataset for this purpose, training the model to predict the next characters in a sequence. The intention is to mimic, on a small scale, the functionalities of ChatGPT.

The author then discusses the concept of tokenization, which is the process of converting raw text into sequences of integers or tokens. This is done by mapping each unique character in the text to a unique integer. These integers can then be used to generate texts, and can also be reconverted back into the original text through a decoding process that involves using the reverse mapping.
