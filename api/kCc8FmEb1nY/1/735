The section being referred to describes how different text encoding/tokenizing systems work with AI models. The lecturer introduces ways to represent text as numerical inputs for an AI - here, for a model using the Transformer architecture.

In his example, he creates a "tokenizer" in Python that converts characters into corresponding integers based on a sorted list of all unique characters (the vocabulary) in the text data being used. This "encoding" creates a sequence of integers representing the original text, and this can be reversed ("decoded") to retrieve the original text.

He goes on to mention other tokenizer options, like 'sentence piece' used by Google and 'pipe pair encoding tokenizer' by OpenAI. These work differently, and instead of mapping each character to an integer, they represent sub-words or whole words as integers, with a much larger vocabulary extending to tens of thousands of tokens. 

The integers mentioned ("between 0 and 50,256") refer to the range of possible integers that can represent tokens in the system used by OpenAI's GPT2, whereas the custom character-based tokenizer used in the lecturer's example has 65 possible tokens.
