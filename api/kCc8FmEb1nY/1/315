This phrase refers to the way AI technologies like ChatGPT work. The user provides a starting point or prompt, such as a sentence or a question. The AI then generates a completion of the sequence, constructing a coherent and contextually appropriate response based on the initial prompt. This response can be a continuation of a story, an answer to a question, or even a creative piece like a poem or news article. The AI ascertains the patterns and structures in the sample text and uses those to predict and provide a suitable completion. It's essentially a sequence prediction task performed by the AI system.
