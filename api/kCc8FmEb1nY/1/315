The term "character by character" refers to the manner in which the Transformative AI language model works by predicting the next character in a given sequence. It does this by looking at the context of characters that have previously appeared and based on that, predicting what character is likely to come next. So, in the example given, using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, if given a particular sequence of characters from a Shakespearean work, the model will generate or predict the subsequent character, thus creating an output that resembles Shakespeare's writing style. The term signifies the specific level at which the model operates while generating text.
