This appears to be a detailed explanation of setting up a model like ChatGPT, a language model powered by a neural network called the Transformer. The presenter is describing the process of preparing data for input into the model by tokenizing text (converting it into a string of integers) and splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets. The last line, "And this will help us understand to what extent our model is overfitting", refers to the common machine learning practice of setting aside some data (the validation set) to test the trained model. This allows the researchers to see whether the model is learning to make predictions well based on the training data, or if it is simply memorizing the training data (overfitting). It allows them to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
