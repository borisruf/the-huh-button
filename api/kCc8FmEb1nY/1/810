In this dialogue, the speaker is discussing how the ChatGPT language model works. They underline how this model generates language and explain some of the underlying processes. This includes the Transformer architecture utilized and the tokenization of the language. The speaker then discusses their plan to create their own simpler version of this model. They go on to explain how they have tokenized the text on a character-level, translating the individual characters into integers. These integers can then be processed by the AI and decoded back into the original characters. The speaker notes that this simple character-level tokenizer is not typically used in practice, with more complex models often using sub-word units instead. The speaker finishes by demonstrating how they have tokenized a sample of text from Shakespeare, turning it into a sequence of integers.
