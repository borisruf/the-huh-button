The phrase "Here, I open the "input" refers to the opening of the input file, which in this case is the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. The speaker is using the programming language Python, and likely using a method like ".open()" to open the file and read its content. This method is generally used when working with files in Python. The 'input' thus refers to the file that contains the data that would be used to train the Transformer model the speaker is referencing. The dataset contains Shakespeare's plays, and the model will learn from it to generate text in a similar style.
