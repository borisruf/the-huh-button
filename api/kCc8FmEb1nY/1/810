This lengthy monologue from Andrej is explaining how to work with a simplified version of the language model: ChatGPT. Andrej breaks down how the system builds sequences of words or characters and decides what comes next based on training from large amounts of data. In this instance, he decides to demonstrate using a scaled-back dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all of Shakespeare's works. Andrej's aim here is to create a character-level language model using a Transformer neural network architecture under the hood and demonstrates how it can predict the next characters in a sequence. He also mentions his GitHub repository, 'nano GPT', that contains the whole code base for this project. Andrej's goal in the video is to explain the inner workings of language models like GPT-3 to his audience, assuming they have a decent grasp of Python, calculus, and statistics.
