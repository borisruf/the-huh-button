The speaker mentions, "Here, I open the 'input'" in the context of starting the process of working with the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset in a Google Colab Jupyter notebook. The term 'input' likely refers to the data file that contains the text of Shakespeare's works. Once opened, this data will be fed into a transformer modeled after GPT to train it in predicting sequences of text. The speaker is using this as an example to illustrate how these types of AI systems, including ChatGPT, operate.
