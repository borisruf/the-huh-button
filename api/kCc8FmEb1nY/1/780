The explanation describes how the complete dataset of text is transformed into a sequence of integers. This process is known as tokenization. For instance, in the context of training AI models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), each unique word in the text is assigned a specific integer. The initial text is then changed into a series of these integers, yielding a large sequence. This sequence effectively retains all the information from the original text, but in a format that the model can efficiently process and learn from.
