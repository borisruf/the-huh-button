Andrej shares that he will focus on the components that make the AI system ChatGPT work. The neural network that facilitates this is from a 2017 paper called "Attention is All You Need" which proposed the Transformer architecture. He explains that GPT in 'generatively pre-trained Transformer' (part of ChatGPT's full name) describes the Transformer architecture. He further elaborates that this architecture, born from a machine translation context, has been utilized in many other AI applications in the years following its inception. Andrej looks to replicate something similar to ChatGPT's functionality using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, though he clarifies that they will not be able to accurately reproduce ChatGPT as it is a sophisticated, production-grade system with complex pre-training and fine-tuning stages. His aim is to provide a deeper understanding of how these systems function.
