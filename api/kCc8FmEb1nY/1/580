The phrase "So, for example, 46, 47, etc." in this context pertains to the integer representations of text characters. As part of explaining how the tokenization process works in transforming raw text into a sequence of integers, a hypothetical scenario is given where the text "hi there" is translated into a list of integers such as 46, 47, etc. Each number represents an individual character, and together, these numbers form the integer representation of the text, serving as input for the transformer neural network the speaker is discussing.
