The speaker is describing how a language model like ChatGPT works. When presented with a piece of text (the beginning of a sequence), the model is programmed to continue the sequence based on patterns it has learned from large volumes of training data. In this context, the 'outcome' is the rest of the text sequence that the model generates in response. The completed sequence can vary each time due to the probabilistic nature of the model, thus allowing the AI to create multiple, unique responses to a single prompt.
