The speaker is giving an overview of GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) and its conversational offspring, ChatGPT, which can generate human-like text based on context or prompts given to it. The speaker uses examples to illustrate this point and then explains how he plans to build a similar, smaller-scale model using the Transformer architecture introduced in a 2017 research paper. The speaker aims to train a character-level language model on a small dataset, 'Tiny Shakespeare', rather than on large internet datasets as done with GPT-2. The statement "This is just to prove that the code base is correctly arranged" refers to the speaker's aim to demonstrate that their created model code is correctly built by successfully training it on a smaller scale.
