This explanation describes the use and functionality of the AI-powered tool called ChatGPT. The speaker uses an example to demonstrate what happens when the AI model is "fed" a prompt and how it produces a sequence of words to form a coherent and contextually relevant text. The speaker goes on to explain the structure and workings of the AI model and how it uses a Transformer architecture to understand and generate language sequences. This model is trained using a large dataset, in this example, using the Open Webtext dataset which comprises of a large number of web pages, which resulted in a performance similar to that of GPT2.
