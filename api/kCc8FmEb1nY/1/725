The speaker, presumably an AI or programming instructor, is explaining their process for developing a simplified version of OpenAI's ChatGPT, using a model called "Transformer" and a small training data set called "Tiny Shakespeare". This is all being carried out in a programming environment called Google Colab, and the speaker aims to show the audience how this complex application is developed from start to finish. The line "Here, I open the "input" is an introduction to the next part of the demonstration, where the speaker will likely open and inspect the Shakespeare training data.
