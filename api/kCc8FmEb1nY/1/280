This statement refers to the output from the 'Tiny Shakespeare' trained AI. Once the language model (Transformer) is trained on Shakespeare's works, giving it a sequence of characters will result in it predicting the next most likely character. The resulting output may sound like an extract from Shakespeare's works but is not a genuine Shakespearean piece. In other words, the AI can generate text that bears a stylistic resemblance to Shakespeare's writing, but is not a genuine work by the author.
