Giving the start of a sequence to the ChatGPT AI prompts it to complete the sequence based on its understanding of language patterns. This sequence can be a sentence, a poem, a news headline, or any type of text-based task. The AI uses its 'language model' to generate the rest of the sequence in a way that aligns with the given start of the sequence. It does so by predicting what words, characters, or tokens might logically follow the provided prompt, based on the vast amount of text data it has been trained on. Hence, the AI's output, or 'outcome', is generated by completing the given sequence in a meaningful and contextually appropriate way.
