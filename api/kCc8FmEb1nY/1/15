Imagine having a sophisticated chatbot that you can talk to. This chatbot, powered by AI (Artificial Intelligence), is able to understand the instructions you provide in the form of texts and can act on them. This is what ChatGPT is. For instance, you can give it commands such as "read my emails" or questions like "what's the weather like?" and it would be able to process that information and provide suitable responses or perform the requested tasks. It allows for a way to conveniently communicate and command an artificial intelligence system using natural language.
