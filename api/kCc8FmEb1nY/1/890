Andrej plans to explain how Chat GPT works by creating a simplified version of the system using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. Using a new Google Colab Jupyter notebook, he will build up the Transformer-based language model from scratch, aiming to train the model to generate sequences that resemble the style of Shakespeare. While the text generated is not exactly Shakespeare, it mimics the patterns in Shakespeare's writing. The objective of this project is to help people understand how Chat GPT functions under the hood. All that is required to follow along is proficiency in Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics. Andrej further suggests that it might be helpful to view his past educational videos on smaller, simpler neural network language models.
