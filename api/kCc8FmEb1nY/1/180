In the context given, the sequence mentioned is a sequence of text or words that are provided as a prompt or input to the AI, ChatGPT. Completing the sequence refers to the AI generating a response that logically continues the input given, based on its learned patterns and knowledge of English language. It's trained to predict or generate what comes next in a sequence (could be a sentence or a conversation). So, when you provide it with the start of a sequence, it finishes or 'completes' the sequence to provide an outcome. For instance, if given the start of a sentence like "AI is...", depending on its training and programming, it might complete it as "AI is a transformative technology".
