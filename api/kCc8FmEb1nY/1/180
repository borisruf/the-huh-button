The phrase "And that includes at the core of Chat GPT" in this context refers to the use of the Transformer architecture in the underlying structure of ChatGPT. The Transformer architecture, initially proposed in a 2017 paper titled "Attention is All You Need", has become one of the most commonly used architectures in the field of AI due to its effectiveness. While the original use was intended for machine translation, this architecture has since been adapted and incorporated into many applications, including ChatGPT. The Transformer architecture is what enables the AI to generate responses and complete tasks in a text-based format.
