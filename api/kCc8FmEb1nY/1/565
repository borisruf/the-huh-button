Andrej plans to create a simplified version of ChatGPT from scratch, using the Transformer model for predicting language patterns in sequence. He will train this model using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, producing sequences of characters that imitate the style of Shakespeare. He aims to help viewers understand how the complex systems of ChatGPT function at a fundamental level. His demonstration requires familiarity with Python, basic calculus, and statistics, and is aided by previous educational videos on his YouTube channel. The completed code for this project will be shared in a Google Colab Jupyter notebook.
