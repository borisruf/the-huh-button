In this text, the speaker, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) expert, is initially discussing the capabilities of ChatGPT, an AI system that can generate written text in response to prompts. It can produce different responses to the same prompt since it is a probabilistic system. The speaker then expresses his intention to focus on the underlying elements that make Chat GPT work. He explains that the neural network underpinning this is the Transformer, which models sequences of words. 

The speaker then proposes to build a simplified version of ChatGPT using the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset to train a Transformer-based language model. He highlights that they will model how characters follow each other in the works of Shakespeare. For instance, given a context of characters in the past, the Transformer neural network would guess what character likely comes next in the sequence. The goal is to generate text that mimics Shakespeare's language. They clarify that this process is very similar to ChatGPT, but their model will work at a character level while ChatGPT operates at token level. 

Towards the end of this text, the speaker mentions a GitHub repository named "nano GPT", which contains all the code written for this project. This lecture aims to rewrite this repository from scratch using Google Colab, with the intention of helping others understand how Chat GPT works.
