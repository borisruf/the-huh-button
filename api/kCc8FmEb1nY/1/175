This passage describes the impact of the Transformer architecture, which was first developed for machine translation. This architecture, proposed in a 2017 paper called "Attention Is All You Need," has significantly impacted the broader field of AI. Specifically, it is at the core of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models, including ChatGPT, a language model capable of generating human-like text. Despite being initially developed for machine translation, the Transformer's ability to understand and generate sequences made it valuable for a wide range of AI tasks. Over the next five years, it influenced many areas of AI beyond its original scope.
