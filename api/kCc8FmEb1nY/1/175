The speaker is explaining how a language model AI (like ChatGPT) works. The model is given a set of initial inputs (the start of a sequence), it generates the following sequence of words or tokens (completes the sequence) based on its understanding of how words or phrases typically follow each other in English language. This completion of the sequence forms the AI's response. Due to its probabilistic nature, for each prompt, it can generate multiple different but contextually relevant responses.
