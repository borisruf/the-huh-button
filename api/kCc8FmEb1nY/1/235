This statement is about how language models, such as ChatGPT, work. They model the sequence of words, characters, or tokens in a language. How they function is by predicting and generating a sequence based on a given input. In other words, when you provide an initial sequence or a prompt, these models will predict and complete the sequence, generating an outcome that follows the language patterns it has learned. It's like giving it the start of a story, and it makes up the rest based on what it knows.
