In this context, "Speare in a single file" refers to a text file containing all works of William Shakespeare concatenated together, referred to as the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. This dataset is often used in tutorials or experiments in natural language processing or machine learning, because despite its relatively small size, it contains complex linguistic structures making it a challenging task for models to learn from. The speaker in this text proposes to use this 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset to train a Transformer-based language model, similar to the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) model used by OpenAI's ChatGPT.
