The information is concerning the process of training a Transformer-based language model. In particular, the data set used (a compendium of Shakespeare's works) will be divided, with the first 90% designated as training data for the model and the remaining 10% used as validation data. This split allows for the model to be trained thoroughly while still retaining data to evaluate it on. The goal is for the model to be able to predict a sequence of characters based on previous context, thereby modelling the text patterns in the data.
