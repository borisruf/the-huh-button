The video presenter, Andrej, intends to demonstrate how to build a language model similar to ChatGPT, using the Transformer architecture. He plans to train this model on a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which consists of all Shakespeare's works and is small enough to be managed. After training the system, it will be able to generate infinite 'Shakespeare-like' text. Andrej intends to simplify the process for his viewers, aiming to help them understand and appreciate how the language model, ChatGPT, works.
