In this passage, the speaker is about to delve into creating a script for training a simple transformer-based language model. The code is going to be written in a Google Colab Jupyter notebook. As a beginning step, the speaker downloaded the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data set. The phrase "Here, I open the 'input" likely refers to the initiation of reviewing or processing the downloaded text data. This dataset, which is a compilation of Shakespeare's works, will be used to train the language model. Essentially, the model will learn the patterns in Shakespeare's text and then be able to generate text in a similar style.
