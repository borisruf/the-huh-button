In his final statement, Andrej plans to start from scratch and create a transformer piece by piece. He intends to train the transformer on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset and see the results in the form of infinite Shakespeare-like content. This sequence can be employed to other text data that viewers find interesting. Andrej's primary goal is to explain and demonstrate how Chat GPT runs in a comprehensible manner. The programming language Python, coupled with a basic knowledge of calculus and statistics, is essential for this process. Previous videos he has made are suggested for viewers to understand the context better. In this particular video, Andrej will concentrate on the Transformer neural network and its operation. Andrej uses a Google Colab Jupyter notebook, which enables him to conveniently share the developing code for viewers to follow. He has already initialized some details and has acquired the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
