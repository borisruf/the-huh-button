In this extensive passage, the speaker talks about the inner workings of a language model and the practical application of transforming raw text into token numbers through models like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and Tiny Shakespeare. These models mainly convert raw text into token numbers and can also do the opposite - translating these tokens back into raw text. 

In response to the statement, "To decode it back, we use the reverse mapping and concatenate all of it", it means that once the language model has converted the raw text into numbers (tokenization), decoding it back involves transforming these numbers back into text. This is done using a reverse map of the initial conversion (from text to numbers) and then combining or 'concatenating' all the resulting pieces to reconstruct the original text or a variation of it, as per the capabilities of the AI language model.
