The snippet of code featured in this explanation is one that translates back and forth between characters and integers. This is used for the process of text tokenization in which a raw string (in this context, the characters in Shakespeare’s work) is converted into a sequence of integers. This is done using an encoder that translates characters into integers and a decoder which reverses this process, translating integers back into characters. 

The look-up tables are produced by iterating over all the characters within the body of Shakespeare's work and creating a corresponding integer for each one. At any given moment, the AI model can predict the next character in a sequence by determining the most probable next integer, based on the sequences it has been trained on.

This is important because computers cannot easily read and process text data—the data needs to be first converted into a format that computers can understand (in this case, integers). Later these integers can be converted back into text data once the computer has completed its processing. The described technique is called tokenization, and it's a common method used in natural language processing tasks.
