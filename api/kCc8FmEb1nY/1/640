Andrej is discussing that his goal is to build a simplified version of ChatGPT to help viewers understand how it works. However, he won't replicate ChatGPT exactly given its complexity and the massive amount of data needed. Instead, he will work with a smaller dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He plans to train a Transformer-based language model to predict sequences in this dataset. After training the model, he will generate pseudo-Shakespearean text. He has already pre-written the code for training these Transformers and shared it on GitHub as a repository called 'nano GPT'. He aims to demonstrate how to build this repository from scratch using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook that will be shared in the video description. Basic knowledge in Python, calculus, statistics, and familiarity with Andrej's previous videos are helpful for following along with this one.
