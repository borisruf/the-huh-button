ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can be interacted with through text-based tasks. For instance, you can instruct it to compose a haiku (a traditional form of Japanese poetry) concerning the importance of AI understanding. The ultimate goal is for people to use this understanding of AI, augmented by such tools as ChatGPT, to advance the world and increase prosperity.
