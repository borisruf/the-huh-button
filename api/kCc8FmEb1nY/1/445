The speaker is describing the function of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. The phrase "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" refers to how this model operates. The user (in this case, the speaker) provides a sequence of words, which is a prompt that initiates the 'conversation'. The model then processes this starting sequence and generates a coherent and context-appropriate continuation, thereby 'completing' the sequence. It does this by predicting the likelihood of each subsequent word based on its training on large amounts of text. Each time this AI is run, it can generate different outcomes from the same prompt, as it operates on probability. This feature makes ChatGPT an effective tool for diverse tasks involving language generation.
