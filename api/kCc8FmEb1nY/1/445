The text is a conversation discussing the strengths of Open AI's Chat GPT, a system that allows interaction with an AI through text-based tasks. The speaker gives humorous examples of Chat GPT prompts and responses to illustrate the AI's ability to generate relevant, nuanced, and, at times, comedic responses. 

The speaker then delves into the underlying architecture of Chat GPT, explaining it's built on the Transformer architecture. This architecture was outlined in a landmark 2017 paper, "Attention is All You Need". The paper’s authors initially intended the Transformer architecture for machine translation. However, it ended up becoming a cornerstone in many AI applications, including Chat GPT.

The speaker mentions a wish to build a version of Chat GPT that's based on a smaller dataset — 'Tiny Shakespeare.' Tiny Shakespeare essentially compiles all of Shakespeare's written works into a single file, which amounts to roughly one megabyte of text. The speaker's objective is to train a Transformer to predict the succession of characters in Shakespeare's work, essentially allowing this system to generate "fake Shakespeare.”

Finally, the speaker refers to a Google Colab Jupyter notebook they created to further explore and better understand the Transformer-based language model that underlies Chat GPT.
