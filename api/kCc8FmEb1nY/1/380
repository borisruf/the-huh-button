Andrej indicates that ChatGPT, the AI system he is discussing, is a language model. This means that it models the sequence of words, characters, or tokens. The AI system understands the English language and how words typically follow each other. When given a starting sequence, ChatGPT completes the sequence with an outcome, thus generating results based on prompts given to it.
