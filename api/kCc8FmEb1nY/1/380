In this passage, the speaker is explaining about ChatGPT, which is an AI system designed for text-based tasks that models language sequence. The system has a neural network that employs the use of the Transformer architecture. The speaker then goes on to explain a project that trains a Transformer-based 'character-level language model' on a concatenation of all of the works of Shakespeare, demonstrating how the Transformer uses the given information to predict the next character sequence.

Towards the end, the speaker refers to Nano GPT, a Github repository for training Transformers on any given text. It comprises two important files: one file defines the GPT model, which stands for 'generally pre-trained Transformer', using the Transformer architecture as the neural network, and the other file trains this model using some given text dataset. Both files are said to be simple because it's made of approximately 300 lines each.
