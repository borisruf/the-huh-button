The phrase "This is just to prove that the code base is correctly arranged" refers to the author's process of successfully reproducing the smallest version (124-million-parameter model) of OpenAI's GPT from 2017 using the code from their own GPT repository, Nano GPT. By doing this, they demonstrate that their code base is written and structured correctly, as it can train Transformers on any given text and successfully imitate the performance of a complex AI model like GPT-2. This offers some assurance that the code can be used as a building block or baseline for further research or development.
