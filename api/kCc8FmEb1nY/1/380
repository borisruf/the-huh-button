In this context, giving the start of a sequence and having it complete the sequence with the outcome refers to introducing an initial prompt to the AI, which is GPT-3 in this case, and then the AI generates the rest of the text that logically follows from the prompt based on its training data. The initial prompt can be seen as the start of a sequence and the generated text is the outcome or completion of the sequence. By understanding the patterns and relationships between words, phrases, and sentences, a language model like ChatGPT can predict and generate contextually relevant text.
