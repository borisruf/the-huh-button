The narrator is discussing using a dataset to train a Transformer-based language model, specifically, the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. A Transformer, in this context, is a type of neural network architecture used in natural language processing. After explaining the application of ChatGPT and Transformers, the speaker describes their intention to try to create a similar system using 'Tiny Shakespeare.' 

The speaker continues by explaining that the system works by predicting the next character in a sequence. For example, given a chunk of characters from a Shakespearean play, the model will predict what character should reasonably follow. After the model has been trained on this dataset, it will be able to generate text that is stylistically similar to Shakespearean prose. 

The speaker also briefly introduces a code library they have developed for training Transformer models, which is named NanoGPT. It is a very simplified version to train Transformers, breaking it down to just two files, and it's been tested and validated on the GPT-2 model for accuracy. 

The line "Here, I open the "input"" likely relates to the speaker preparing to write and run code in a Jupyter notebook, specific code that will load or open their input data, in this case, the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset.
