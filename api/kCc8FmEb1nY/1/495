Andrej is aiming to build a Transformer-based language model using his preferred small dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which includes all the works of Shakespeare. His goal is to help viewers understand how the system 'Chat GPT' operates from a linguistic model perspective. The video will delve into coding the Transformer neural network bit by bit, and later use it to train on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. This content will be accessible to anyone proficient in Python and with a basic understanding of calculus and statistics. Andrej emphasizes that alongside this focus on the Transformer neural network, his other videos provide context for understanding language modeling frameworks.
