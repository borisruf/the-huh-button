This is a demonstration on how to train an artificial intelligence language model using the Transformer architecture, which is the underlying technology that powers AI models like ChatGPT. The speaker proposes using a toy data set, Tiny Shakespeare, to train a Transformer-based language model. The purpose is to illustrate how to train a Transformer to predict the next character in a sequence, based on previous characters. To do this, they create a new Google collab, a Jupyter Notebook file, with some preliminary code to download the dataset, and then open it as 'input'. This helps to set up the initial stages of the training exercise.
