The final sentence in the transcript highlights how Andrej is planning to start the coding process. He has prepared a Jupyter notebook using Google Colab, and as part of his initial setting up, he has downloaded the Tiny Shakespeare dataset from a designated URL. This dataset, approximately one megabyte in size, will be used to train a simplistic Transformer-based language model, essentially an imitation of the Chat GPT. The goal is to make viewers understand how the Chat GPT works at the core. All that's required for the session would be proficiency in Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and familiarity with his previous videos would be helpful too. The code written in this session will later be shared via the video description for the viewers to follow along.
