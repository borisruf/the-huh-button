In the context, the explainer is discussing a character-level language model, specifically ChatGPT, which is programmed to generate text based on provided prompts. During the discussion, the explainer makes a distinction between the simplicity of the encoding and decoding functions, and how lengthy the generated sequences can become as a result. Encoding refers to the process of converting raw text data into a format that can be easily understood by the machine learning model, while decoding is the reverse process: converting the modelâ€™s outputs back into human-readable text. Because the encoding and decoding functions are relatively simple, operating at a character level, the sequences produced tend to be long.
