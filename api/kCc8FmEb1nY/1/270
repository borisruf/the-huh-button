The speaker is referring to a function of the ChatGPT program, where it can predict and generate relevant text to complete a given sequence of words. Consider it as writing the next chapter of a book after reading the previous chapters. The user gives the AI the beginning or "prompt" and the AI then generates a logical and appropriate continuation. This process still involves an element of chance, as the AI might yield slightly different responses for the same prompt, but they all would be logical continuations of the sequence presented to it.
