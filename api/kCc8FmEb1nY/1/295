This concept of "generating infinite Shakespeare" refers to the possibility of creating extensive and apparently never-ending texts that mimic the style and language of William Shakespeare by utilizing AI systems like ChatGPT. These AI systems use neural networks (the Transformer architecture, in this case) to model and predict language sequences based on previously learned data (e.g. the texts of Shakespeare's works). With this model, they can generate new text in response to prompts that closely resemble the style and structure of Shakespeare's language. It's important to note, though, that while this text may mimic Shakespeare's style, it isn't authentic or derived from any actual Shakespearean works, which is why it is described as "a fake thing that looks kind of like Shakespeare."
