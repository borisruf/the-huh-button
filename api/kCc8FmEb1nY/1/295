This statement is describing the way that ChatGPT, an AI language model, generates text. A user gives it a seed text or prompt (the start of a sequence), and the AI uses its understanding of human language patterns to continue the sequence in a contextually relevant way. It does this by predicting what words are likely to follow the provided input based on the vast amounts of text data it was trained on. This is not deterministic but probabilistic, meaning it can provide different completions for the same input prompt each time it is run.
