The speaker is describing the process of using a Transformer-based neural network as a language model. They are using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset to train the model, which involves the network predicting the following character based on a sequence of existing characters. The model does this since it's been trained on all the works of Shakespeare, learning the nuances and patterns of Shakespeare's writing style. Once trained, the network can generate text that is reminiscent of Shakespeare's language. The speaker mentions that this won't be perfect and will generate a 'fake' Shakespeare-like language. They illustrate this by showing the network generating text character by character. The language generation of the AI highlights how text-based AI like Chat GPT works, i.e., by predicting and generating text based on previously learned and observed patterns.
