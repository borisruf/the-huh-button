The sequence referenced in the context is a text-based task or a prompt that is given to ChatGPT. It provides the initial data fed into the AI system. Upon receiving this prompt, ChatGPT uses its language model to generate an appropriate continuation based on its understanding of how words follow each other in the English language. The completed sequence is the text generated by ChatGPT in response to the prompt. Thus, when they say "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome", theyâ€™re referring to providing ChatGPT with a prompt and the AI producing a completed text in response.
