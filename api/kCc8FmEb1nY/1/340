A nano GPT is a scaled-down version of the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. In the given context, a nano GPT is used to generate text that mimics the style of Shakespeare's works. This is made possible by training the Transformer on all works of Shakespeare. The trained model can then predict what character is likely to come next in a given sequence, thereby generating artificial, but realistic Shakespeare-like language. This model operates on a smaller scale, and thus called "nano", compared to a production-grade system like ChatGPT, which models the sequence of not just characters but tokens (sub-word pieces), making it more complex and capable of handling a much larger dataset.
