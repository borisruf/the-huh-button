Andrej explains that he is using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook to create a Transformer, a type of neural network model. He intends to train this model on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which is a small compilation of Shakespeare's works. The objective of this experiment is to illustrate how a language model like ChatGPT, which uses the Transformer model, works 'under the hood'. The transformed model will be trained to predict the next character in a sequence based on the characters that come before it, thereby emulating Shakespeare's unique writing style. This simplified example will be built from scratch and serves as a stepping stone towards understanding more complex AI systems like ChatGPT.
