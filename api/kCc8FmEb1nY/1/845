In the video, Andrej outlines his plan to build and train a simplified language model, similar to the complex system used in ChatGPT that uses the Transformer architecture. The model he will work on is a character-based system using a small data set known as 'Tiny Shakespeare,' which includes all the written works of Shakespeare. By training the model on this data, he plans to make it predict the sequence of characters, essentially generating texts that resemble Shakespeare's language. Andrej mentions that he has already written the code to train this simplified model and put it in a GitHub repository named 'nano GPT'. He clarifies that his aim is to help viewers understand how ChatGPT operates beneath the surface, and to replicate this process, specific skills in Python, understanding of calculus and statistics, and familiarity with prior videos on his YouTube channel would be beneficial. The lesson will be shared through a Google Colab Jupyter notebook.
