In this context, "it knows how words follow each other in the English language" speaks to the proficiency of ChatGPT as a language model. It has learned the patterns, syntax, and sequences in which words typically occur in English language text. This allows it to generate human-like text that is contextually appropriate and makes grammatical sense. It understands the probabilistic relationships between words and uses this "knowledge" to predict the next word in a sentence or phrase, which is why it can generate diverse and coherent outputs for the same prompt.
