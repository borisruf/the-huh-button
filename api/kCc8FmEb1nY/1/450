The speaker here is explaining how to create a simplified version of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model. The speaker mentions that this task requires proficiency in Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics. Python is the coding language used to build ChatGPT and the version that you'll be creating. They also warn that it will take some understanding of calculus, as some calculations are necessary to build the model. As for statistics, knowledge in this area is required because building language models involves working with probabilistic systems. Overall, the speaker is trying to aid the listener to appreciate and understand how a complex AI model like ChatGPT operates.
