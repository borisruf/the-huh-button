The statement "This will allow me to easily share the code we're going to develop, so you can follow along." is made by the person who is leading a session on how to build a Transformer-based language model. The leader of the session is using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook, a collaborative tool that enables users to write and share code. By sharing the code, participants in the session can actively participate, follow along, and better understand the process being explained. This gives them a hands-on learning experience, helping them better understand the concepts and steps involved in working with a Transformer-based language model.
