The speaker here is discussing the capabilities of ChatGPT, a type of AI language model. They explain that the model completes sequences of words based on input given to it. As an example, if the user starts a sequence such as "Please write a breaking news article about," ChatGPT can complete the sequence with a coherent and contextually appropriate outcome, like a faux news report about a leaf falling from a tree. The sequences generated by the model are based on its internal representation of how words and phrases follow each other in English language texts. Probabilistic in nature, the model can generate multiple potential completions for the same input sequence, resulting in diverse responses.
