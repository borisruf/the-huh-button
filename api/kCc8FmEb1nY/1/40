AI models, such as ChatGPT, are designed to generate outcomes based on predictions about what is most likely to follow from a given input. Although these models have trained on large amount of text, they don't "understand" text in the way humans do and facilitate creativity and unpredictability. Hence, if the same prompt is fed into the model at different times, it can generate distinct responses as it generates words sequentially based on probabilities, not based on a fixed rule or predefined script. This is why there was a different outcome when the same prompt was given earlier to ChatGPT.
