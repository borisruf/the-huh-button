This passage explains that ChatGPT, a text-based AI system, can generate content for different tasks such as writing a haiku. It mentions that even when given the exact same prompt, ChatGPT can generate slightly different results. This unpredictability is a feature of AI language models like ChatGPT; while there may be some consistency in response to the same prompt, AI has a level of unpredictability and randomness to avoid repetitive responses. Variability in responses improves the AI's ability to create natural, human-like conversation.
