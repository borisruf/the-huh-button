In the given context, the speaker is discussing creating a model or system which resembles ChatGPT, a machine learning model used for generating text. To do so, they have decided on using a smaller dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. They explain that the process involves modelling how characters (letters, not personas) follow each other to form words and sentences. They indicate that the input refers to a series of characters or the beginning of a sequence which serves as a guide for the system to predict or generate the next likely sequence of characters. They apply this to the Tiny Shakespeare data set, a concatenation of all the works of Shakespeare. This description signifies on opening the "input" to the machine learning system here.
