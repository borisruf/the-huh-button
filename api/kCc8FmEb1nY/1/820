The host is building an AI model that generates Shakespearean text. He's using PyTorch to create a character-level language model. The host tokenizes the data (turns words into numbers, which are easier for the model to understand) and separates it into a training and a test set. The model will train on 90% of the data and use the remaining 10% to validate its performance, measuring how well it can predict or generate similar content. The host aims to create a model that can accurately predict or generate Shakespeare-like text, rather than just precisely memorizing and repeating lines from the dataset.
