In the last sentence, Andrej is introducing the viewers to preparation and preliminary steps he has taken in setting the stage for the coding tutorial. He has set up a Google Colab Jupyter notebook that he will be sharing with the audience for them to follow along with the exercises. Moreover, he has downloaded a file called the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which he plans to use in the tutorial. This dataset includes all of Shakespeare's works and it will be used to train the language model later on.
