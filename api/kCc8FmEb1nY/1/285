The speaker is referring to how a language model such as ChatGPT works. When they say that they "give it the start of a sequence," they refer to providing an initial input or prompt to the AI. The system then anticipates or predicts what should logically or contextually follow next based on its understanding of the English language and past data it has been trained on, thus "completing the sequence." In this way, the AI generates a response or 'outcome' that fits the context of the original input. The response can vary each time the same prompt is given due to the probabilistic nature of the model.
