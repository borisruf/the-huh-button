The speaker in the provided context discusses a machine learning model called GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). GPT, originating from a 2017 paper titled "Attention is All You Need," is a language model capable of generating text based on prompts given to it. The speaker highlights its utilization in the AI system ChatGPT, which generates text responses based on entered prompts. 

Moving on, the speaker underscores his intention to provide a simple educational model of how these systems work by training a Transformer-based language model on a dataset dubbed 'Tiny Shakespeare.' This process involves training the Transformer to predict the sequence of the text in the dataset, which results in the model's ability to generate text that resembles Shakespearean language. 

The speaker ends by mentioning the GitHub repository named Nano GPT where he has already written code to train these transformers. He intends to use a Google Colab Jupyter notebook to start from scratch and define a Transformer piece by piece, train it on the Tiny Shakespeare data set, and generate infinite Shakespeare.

However, your question "Here, I open the "input" needs more context to provide a specific answer. In general, opening the "input" could refer to accessing a file that provides input data, such as the Tiny Shakespeare text file in this case. This input file would be used to train the language model.
