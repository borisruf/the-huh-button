The passage is discussing how text is translated into sequences of integers for natural language processing tasks. These sequences are based on the concept of "tokens," with each unique token represented by a unique integer. In the example given in the passage, tokens are single characters, and the system is limited to a vocabulary of 65 unique tokens.

However, systems like GPT-2 use a different approach. They utilize a tokenizer called "Tick Token" that uses Byte Pair Encoding and words are not split into individual characters, but rather into "sub-word" units. This results in a much larger vocabulary - in GPT-2's case, 50,000 unique tokens. 

This larger vocabulary is more complex but provides richer representation. It is better at capturing semantic meaning and recognizing different forms of the same word. This is one of the reasons why GPT-2's language generation capabilities are so advanced.
