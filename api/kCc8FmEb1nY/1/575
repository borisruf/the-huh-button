Andrej is explaining how he will demonstrate the workings of the Transformer neural network, a key component of Chat GPT. He plans to use a toy data set 'Tiny Shakespeare' as an example to train a Transformer-based language model and show character prediction in sequences similar to how Chat GPT works. Despite his intention to simplify the process, he acknowledges that his rendition cannot fully reproduce the complex production-grade system of Chat GPT. The code he has written for training these Transformers is housed in his GitHub repository called 'Nano GPT'. Andrej ends his discussion by mentioning that following this video will require proficiency in Python, a basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and familiarity with his previous videos, particularly the "Make More" series.
