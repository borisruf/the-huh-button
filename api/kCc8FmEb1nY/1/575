In this context, the speaker is going through the process of explaining the algorithm behind the AI model ChatGPT. They are demonstrating how the model is trained and how it generates text. The speaker provided examples, prompted the AI for different tasks and explained how different outcomes can be produced from the same prompt, as the system operates probabilistically. They also spoke about how the transformer architecture on which the AI is based was introduced in a landmark paper called "Attention is All You Need". They then went on to explain how they planned to demonstrate the workings of such a model using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. Finally, they introduced some preliminary code involving the encoding and decoding of characters from the text into numerical tokens or integers which the model uses to process and generate text. The part, "And let me just talk through what's happening here," seems to precede a more detailed explanation or run-through of the code.
