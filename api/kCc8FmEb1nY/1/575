In this context, tokenizing the input text means converting the textual data into smaller units, or tokens. Each token could be an individual word. However, in the example here, each token is a character, as the aim is to predict the next character in a string given previous characters. This is part of pre-processing the data before it is used to train the machine learning model, and it also helps the model understand the structure of the text. In this case, tokenization will involve mapping each unique character to a unique integer. This makes it easier for the machine learning model to work with text data, and subsequently use it to generate new text based on what it has learned about the sequence and structure of the character tokens.
