In this context, the speaker is discussing the capabilities of the AI model, ChatGPT. When the speaker says, "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome", he is referring to how ChatGPT processes and responds to prompts. The 'start of a sequence' is a prompt or task given to the AI, such as 'write a haiku.' The AI then completes the sequence by generating a series of words in response to the prompt, which becomes the outcome. It's essentially a way of describing how the AI takes an input and generates an output.
