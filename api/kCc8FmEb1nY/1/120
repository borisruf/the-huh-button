The speaker is explaining how ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, works. According to them, the AI generates written content in a sequential manner, much like completing a sequence. It uses its understanding of the English language to determine the most probable word or phrase that should follow. Despite giving different responses to the same prompt at times, the AI always aims to provide a coherent and context-relevant sequence of words. This is why the speaker says, "from its perspective, what it is doing is it is completing the sequence".
