In this context, the speaker is introducing OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT, which generates text based on a prompt given by a user. When the speaker says "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome," they are referring to how ChatGPT works. 

They give the AI a starting prompt, which can be considered the start of a sequence of words. In response, the AI generates a continuation, completing the "sequence" with automatically generated words that make sense in the context of the original prompt. The end result is a coherent piece of text that logically extends from the initial prompt. This process demonstrates ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human-like language.
