The phrase "Here, I open the 'input" refers to the stage in the process where the speaker is preparing to open the dataset they will work with, in this case the Tiny Shakespeare data set. They will likely use a programming function to open the file and access the character sequences in order to train a Transformer-based language model. This is part of the process of creating an AI system like ChatGPT, which the speaker is attempting to explain and replicate on a smaller scale.
