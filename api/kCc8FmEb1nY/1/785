In the last sentence of the transcript, Andrej explains that he has carried out preliminary steps in preparation for his demonstration on the Google Colab Jupyter notebook. Specifically, he downloaded the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset and shared the URL for it. He also mentioned that the dataset is approximately one megabyte in size. Additionally, Andrej opened a file called 'input.txt' to show that it is indeed a collection of the works of Shakespeare. This dataset will be used in the next steps to train a Transformer-based language model.
