The summarised explanation of the last sentence is: Andrej plans to create a program to train a Transformer-based language model from scratch using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, with the aim of producing an AI that can generate text modeled after William Shakespeare's works. He hopes this exercise will allow his audience to understand how the AI language model, Chat GPT, functions. He will be doing this in a Google Colab Jupyter notebook which he will later share with his audience for them to follow along. However, to fully comprehend the workings, he recommends that his audience have an understanding of Python, calculus, statistics, and review his earlier videos where he introduces simpler neural network language models.
