This transcript refers to ChatGPT, an AI system that is able to generate a response to a given textual prompt. Andrej explains that the system can provide multiple responses to the same prompt because it's a probabilistic system, hence he received different poems when he asked it to create a haiku about the importance of understanding AI. He went on to give several humorous examples of prompts given to ChatGPT, including asking it to explain HTML like he was a dog or to write a dramatic news article about a leaf falling. Andrej then explains that ChatGPT is a language model, meaning it predicts the sequence of words or characters that follow each other in a given language. Thus, when Andrej gives it the start of a sequence (the prompt), ChatGPT completes the sequence with the outcome (the response).
