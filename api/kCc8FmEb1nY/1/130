The speaker here is describing the function of AI models like ChatGPT. When presented with a starting sequence, like a sentence or a prompt, the AI model will complete the sequence in a manner that is statistically likely, based on its training data. In simpler terms, when given a starting point, the AI can generate a continuation of that starting point in an appropriate and accurate way. An example would be giving the AI a phrase, to which it responds with a full sentence or paragraph relevant to that phrase. The AI doesn't 'understand' the sequence but uses machine learning algorithms to compute the most accurate response.
