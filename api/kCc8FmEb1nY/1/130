A language model is a system that understands sequences of words, also known as tokens. It can predict a sequence of words or complete a given sequence based on its understanding of how words follow each other in a particular language (in this case, English). From the model's perspective, it is merely completing a sequence provided by a user. This means that given the start of a sequence (a prompt), it generates an outcome or a continuation of that sequence that sounds coherent and natural in the English language. This is how the ChatGPT system functions, and hence the term 'language model.'
