ChatGPT and other AI language models work by generating text based on previous context. The author of the lecture explains the process of creating a model to generate text that mimicks Shakespeare's style. The model is called a 'Transformative Language Model'. Training this model requires a dataset which in this case is "Tiny Shakespeare", a collection of all works by Shakespeare.

The model learns by tokenizing the text content â€” turning raw text into a sequence of integers. In this example, the model uses a simple tokenizer that encodes each character individually, but the author notes that in practice, more complex systems such as sub-word tokenizers are used which can represent words or parts of words as single tokens.

The bit about trading off the codebook size and the sequence lengths refers to the fact that different tokenization methods can result in different numbers of unique tokens (the 'codebook') and different token sequence lengths for the same input text. For instance, character-level tokenization will result in shorter codebooks but longer sequence lengths compared to word-level or sub-word level tokenization.
