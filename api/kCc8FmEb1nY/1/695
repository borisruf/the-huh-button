Andrej explains in his video that he will be creating a model similar to ChatGPT using Transformers. This will be a simple version of the model, using a small data set called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He will be training the model to predict the sequence of characters in the data set and generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing. Andrej clarifies that this process will help the viewers understand how Chat GPT works. This process will require proficiency in Python and some basic understanding of calculus and statistics. His final goal is to show the viewers the inner workings of ChatGPT.
