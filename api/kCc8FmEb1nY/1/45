The speaker is discussing their experience with an artificial intelligence system called ChatGPT. They find that by providing this AI with a text-based task – in this example, writing a short poem on the topic of artificial intelligence – the AI produces creative and accurate responses. The speaker notes that even when provided with the exact same prompt, the AI creates slightly different, but both from a quality standpoint, equally good, responses each time.
