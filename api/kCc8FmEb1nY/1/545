Tokenization in natural language processing is the process of breaking up input text into smaller pieces, often words or phrases, which are easier for a machine to understand and analyze. The speaker wants to devise a tokenization strategy for the characters in the text. Their goal is to convert the characters and words into numerical representations that can be input into a machine learning model. This is a critical step in any text analysis task, as it transforms raw, unstructured data into a form that can be processed by algorithms.
