The phrase "Here, I open the 'input" could refer to opening the input dataset. In this context, this is likely referring to the speaker opening the Tiny Shakespeare dataset which they just downloaded in their script code in a Python Jupyter notebook. Upon opening this dataset, they can explore the content, manipulate the data to fit the requirements of the machine learning model that they will be training, or even perform some simple preprocessing tasks.
