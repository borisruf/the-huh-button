The statement, "Here, I open the 'input'" appears to refer to the process of opening the file referred to earlier, the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. The speaker is likely preparing to load or read in this file in preparation for using it to train the Transformer-based language model they are discussing. They would be using a programming language, likely Python as referenced earlier in the talk, to open the file and read its contents into a suitable format for model training.
