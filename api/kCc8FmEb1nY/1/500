The speaker is explaining how to build a simple version of OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), a language model that can generate text. GPT can take an input prompt and generate a variety of responses, as it's a probabilistic system. It creates these responses by predicting the next token (word or character) given the previous tokens.

The speaker's intention is to build a smaller version of GPT, using the Transformer architecture proposed in the 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need". Instead of using a large dataset like the internet, the speaker uses the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, which contains all of Shakespeare's works in a single file.

The goal is to train GPT to predict the next character given previous characters in a sequence. The trained model should be able to generate text that looks like it came from Shakespeare's works.

The code and training process will be described in detail in a Jupyter Notebook, with the aim of helping the audience understand how a system like GPT works. The speaker emphasizes that the project only requires proficiency in Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics. The model codes will be published on GitHub.
