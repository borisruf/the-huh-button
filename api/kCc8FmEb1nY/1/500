The speaker is referring to a Python programming approach. When they say "set constructor," they're referring to a Python method for creating a set object. A set in Python is a collection of unique elements, unordered and unindexed. By calling the set constructor on a string (the "text"), they will get a set of all unique characters that appear in that text. Each character appears only once in a set, which helps to determine the distinct characters found within the text data. This can be useful for many purposes, such as data analysis or generating a character vocabulary.
