Andrei explains that while ChatGPT is a highly complex system trained on a large portion of the internet, he intends to build a simplified transformer-based language model for educational purposes. He chose to train this model using a compact dataset, 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all of the playwright's works in a single file. Once trained, the model should be able to generate linguistic sequences resembling Shakespeare's works. Andrei has also made the code for training these transformers available on his ‘nanoGPT’ repository on GitHub. In this lecture, Andrei will build this repository from scratch using Python on a Google Colab Jupiter notebook. This will provide a practical demonstration of how the mechanics of ChatGPT operate.
