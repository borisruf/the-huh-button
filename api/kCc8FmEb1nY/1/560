The speaker is describing the construction of a simple but functional AI model to generate text similar to the works of Shakespeare. The speaker is using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset for this purpose and is explaining the initial preparations for processing the data. 

In the final part of the explanation, the speaker describes how they take all the unique possible elements from the data, or the "vocabulary", which is all symbols used in the dataset -- including both uppercase, lowercase letters as well as special symbols. They sorted this vocabulary and found it to have a total of 65 characters. This is an essential step to be able to convert these characters into numbers later on, which the AI model can then process.
