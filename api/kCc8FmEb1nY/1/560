In this class, a character-level language model will be created. These types of models are effective for recognizing patterns in the sequences of characters in a text. The speaker is referencing transforming text into numbers through tokenization. In this class, tokenization will be character-level, meaning each individual character (including punctuation and space) will be translated into a unique integer. This approach allows the system to treat text data as numerical data, which in turn lets it use mathematical methods to understand and generate text. They will be using a dataset of Shakespeare's work for their example.
