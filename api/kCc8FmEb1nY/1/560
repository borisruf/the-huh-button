Andrej explains that the neural network that drives the performance of ChatGPT, a language model in AI, is based on a specific type of architecture called the Transformer. This blueprint emerged from a milestone paper in the field published back in 2017 titled "Attention is All You Need," which initially intended this architecture for machine translations. The Transformer architecture is noted for its impact, greatly influencing the development of AI systems for a wide range of applications over the next five years. Andrej plans to show how this works through a simplified example, utilizing a training data set named 'Tiny Shakespeare'. He clarifies that it won't be as complex as ChatGPT as it's an intricate system, but the example will provide valuable insights into how these machine learning models operate. Andrej also provides a link to his GitHub repository named 'nano GPT,' which contains the source code used to train Transformers with any given text.
