This explanation is about how the AI model behind ChatGPT works. ChatGPT is a language model, which means it predicts the sequence of words or tokens based on given input. It generates responses by completing the sequence provided to it. The underlying neural network architecture of ChatGPT comes from a prominent AI research paper called "Attention is All You Need," published in 2017. This paper proposed a new form of neural network architecture known as the Transformer architecture, which has been fundamental in shaping modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models like ChatGPT.
