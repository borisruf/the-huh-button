Andrej explains that ChatGPT is a 'language model', indicating it's capable of modeling the sequence of words, characters, or tokens. This capability is due to the fact that it understands how words follow each other within the English language. Essentially, he describes that ChatGPT functions by completing a provided sequence. When users provide the start of a sequence or a prompt, the AI completes the sequence with the outcome or response.
