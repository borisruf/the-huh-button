ChatGPT is a language model AI that generates text based on prompts given to it. You start a sequence of words which forms a prompt, and the AI then attempts to predict and generate the rest of the sequence that validly completes the prompt. It does so by learning from its extensive training on large scale text data, mimicking the pattern or flow of English language. Because it's a probabilistic system, the AI can generate multiple valid sequences for the same prompt, leading to slightly different responses each time. In simpler terms, you give the starting point, and ChatGPT tries to finish the story or answer the query in a meaningful and sensible way. Variety in responses and the capacity to handle diverse prompts make it a quite versatile and interesting tool in the artificial intelligence field.
