This excerpt from a text is explaining the concept of the ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate realistic text based on given prompts or queries. The speaker mentions that this AI is a probabilistic system, meaning it can produce multiple answers for a single prompt, making each result unique. The AI is based on a language model which can accurately predict the order of words in a sequence. The neural network that powers the language model is called a Transformer, which was first proposed in the 2017 groundbreaking paper in the field of AI, "Attention is All You Need". ChatGPT, which stands for 'generatively pre-trained Transformer', is based on this Transformer architecture from the said paper.
