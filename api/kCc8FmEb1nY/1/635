The speaker here is talking about initiating a specific section of his Python code. In this context, opening the "input" typically involves specifying the source or location of the data set that his program will use. Normally, the data set will be read into the program and stored in a variable for later use. In this case, they're using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. Therefore, opening "input" would be the step where they provide the program the location to access 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The exact details can vary depending on the specific code, programming language, and data set they're using.
