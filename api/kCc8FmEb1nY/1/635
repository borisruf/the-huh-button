The final sentence concludes Andrej's introduction to his project which involves generating text in a Shakespearean language using Tiny Shakespeare dataset and Transformer neural network. On this project he aims to demystify the workings of ChatGPT by engaging in an in-depth examination of the Transformer neural network. He also anticipates that having a basic familiarity with Python, statistics and calculus will be beneficial for understanding the project, as well as watching his previous videos about simpler neural network language models. Andrej plans to code the project on Google Colab in order to allow the audience to follow alongside as he creates this language model.
