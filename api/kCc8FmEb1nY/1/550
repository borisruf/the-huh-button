The speaker is preparing to explain the workings of a specific type of AI, a 'language model' that produces text outputs based on given prompts. To showcase its functionality, the speaker will use an AI model known as a Transformer to train a character-level language model on the writings of William Shakespeare. He's explaining that the Transformer will attempt to predict the next character in a sequence, having trained on previous sequences. A successful training would mean the model could generate text that mimics Shakespeare's writing style. The speaker intends to break down his coding process in Python to further illuminate how this all works. The phrase "Here, I open the 'input" refers to the speaker starting the process of loading the dataset he will be working with.
