In the lecture, the presenter discusses the function and capabilities of ChatGPT, a language model based on the Transformer architecture proposed in the paper "Attention is All You Need". The transformer model has yielded notable results in language generation tasks. Subsequently, the presenter outlines how the model works, describing it as a probabilistic system that generates responses according to prompts provided by users. The presenter emphasises that the system is capable of providing different responses to the same prompt. The lecture introduces plans to recreate a simpler version of ChatGPT, using a character-level language model trained on a toy dataset named 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The presenter concludes by explaining that the code for this model already exists on their GitHub, titled Nano GPT, and they aspire to write this repository from scratch in the lecture.
