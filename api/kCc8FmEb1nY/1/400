In this context, giving the start of a sequence to complete refers to giving an initial prompt or a set of words to the AI model, which, in this case, is ChatGPT. The AI takes these words as an input, processes it, and produces a sequence of words that logically or semantically follows the initial prompt. The AI does all this based on the patterns it has learned from its training data. Its goal is to generate a text that's consistent with the context provided by the initial input. So, the outcome or the text generated by the AI is seen as completing the sequence that started from the initial input.
