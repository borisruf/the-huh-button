GPT2 is a version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer model developed by OpenAI. Introduced in 2017, it uses the transformer neural network model, an architecture that has dominated AI applications over the past five years. GPT2 models sequences of words, characters, or tokens more generally. In the context of the ChatGPT tool mentioned, GPT2 is capable of generating different responses based on a given prompt, meaning it operates as a probabilistic system. This machine learning model works by evaluating historical patterns in text and predicting the likelihood of subsequent characters based on those patterns. An example of how GPT2 works is Nano GPT, a GitHub repository that trains transformers on any given text. GPT2 models are still highly influential in AI, and ChatGPT is an example of one such application, albeit a much more complex one.
