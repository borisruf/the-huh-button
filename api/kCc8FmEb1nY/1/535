The vocabulary of the model refers to the possible elements that the model can both recognize and produce. In the case of this character-level language model, the vocabulary is made up of individual characters that are present in the training data â€“ in this case, all of Shakespeare's works. These characters range from space characters, to special characters, to capital and lower-case letters, and there are 65 in total. The model will learn to predict the likelihood of each character coming next in a sequence, based on the previous characters it has seen. This is how it 'understands' and generates text.
