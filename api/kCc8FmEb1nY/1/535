In this lengthy context, the speaker needs to model a character sequence from the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset using Transformer, a type of neural network. He mentions that Transformers are the basis of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-Trained) models. He aims to build this from scratch to teach his audience how "ChatGPT" works. ChatGPT is an AI system that generates text based on a given prompt. He will not be training the entire internet but will focus on "Tiny Shakespeare". He proposes to make a model based on how the characters follow each other in the works of Shakespeare, predicting the next character based on the generated sequence before. He also shows an existing GitHub repository "Nano GPT", which includes the code for training Transformers on any text. Finally, he says, "Here, I open the 'input" ready to walk through implementing this with the audience.
