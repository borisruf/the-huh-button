In the video, Andrej describes the functionality, applications and under-the-hood components of the transformative AI, ChatGPT from OpenAI. He explains how the system works by modelling the sequence of words and supplying multiple responses to prompts or inquiries. Andrej then delves into the tech manual to explain the neural network, the transformer, that powers the system and how it is used in many AI applications. His detailed explanation includes a brief history of the transformer from a landmark paper titled "Attention is All You Need" in 2017. Towards the end, he proposes working with 'Tiny Shakespeare', a toy data-set for training a Transformer-based language model. He plans to these models from an empty file and demonstrating how they work using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. Finally, he highlights the Python proficiency, an understanding of calculus and statistics, and familiarity with his earlier videos as prerequisites for understanding the building and functionality of the Transformer.
