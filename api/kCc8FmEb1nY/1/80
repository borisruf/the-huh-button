This excerpt from a speech introduces an AI system named ChatGPT - a powerful language model that generates text by predicting the next part of a text sequence based on an inputted prompt. Examples of these prompts could include virtually anything, from composing haikus about AI to simulating breaking news articles about mundane occurrences such as a leaf falling from a tree. The purpose is to demonstrate the flexibility and creativity of the AI, able to provide different and engaging responses to the same prompt based upon a degree of randomness, hence it is probabilistic.
The phrase "Please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree" seems humorously absurd, as it contrasts the banality of a leaf falling from a tree with the urgency and significance usually associated with breaking news. However, it effectively demonstrates the capability of the AI to create engaging content from even the most mundane prompts.
