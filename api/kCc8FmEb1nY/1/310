This text is an AI-generated transcript from a tutorial session on how to use a language model named 'ChatGPT,' which is based on a transformer architecture. The AI randomly generated a Shakespeare-like text from a dataset named 'Tiny Shakespeare,' containing characters from the author's works. The example is a demonstration of how ChatGPT can consume a sequence of characters and predict what is likely to come next, thus producing faux-Shakespearean text.
