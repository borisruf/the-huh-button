In this context, the speaker is referring to the process of how ChatGPT, an AI-based language model, operates. The user gives it a prompt, which is the start of a sequence of words or instructions, and ChatGPT uses machine learning algorithms to predict logical continuations and generates a completion for the sequence. The outcome, or generated text, is the AI's interpretation of the most likely next sentence or phrase based on the input and its understanding of human language patterns. The AI doesn't just generate one predetermine response; instead, it determines a probable outcome from a range of possibilities, meaning different prompts can yield different but relevant responses.
