The phrase "Here, I open the 'input" in the given context seems to indicate the beginning of a process where the speaker is about to open the input data set (in this case, the Tiny Shakespeare data set). They likely mean they will open this file in their coding environment to prepare it for the next steps in the process. These might include tasks such as data cleaning, data preprocessing or directly feeding it into the model, in this case, the Transformer for training.
