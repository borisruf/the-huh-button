In the last sentence of the transcript, Andrej Karpathy mentions that he has opened a new Google Colaboratory (Colab) Jupyter notebook where he will write and develop the new code for training the Transformer neural network. He mentions that this notebook will allow him to share the developed code easily so others can follow along. Links to this notebook will be provided in the video description. He also states that he has performed preliminaries such as downloading the Tiny Shakespeare dataset from a specific URL, indicating that it is about a one-megabyte file. He finishes off by mentioning that he has opened the 'input.txt' file, presumably to start working on the code.
