The passage explains trade-offs in tokenizing text into a sequence of integers for natural language processing or generation. The selection of the tokenizer can influence both the length of the resulting sequence and the vocabulary size. For example, character-level tokenization will give a long sequence of integers but a small vocabulary, as only individual characters are to be processed. Conversely, tokenizing by sub-words or words will give a shorter sequence but a larger vocabulary. The size of the vocabulary typically corresponds to the range of integers that represent the tokens. The tokenizer to use depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
