The text discusses the functioning of language models, focusing particularly on the capabilities of the generative pre-trained Transformer, ChatGPT. The author mentions how ChatGPT, based on the Transformer architecture proposed in the 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need", has the ability to generate human-like responses to various prompts, making it a remarkable system for text-based tasks.  

The author also mentions their intent to train a Transformer-based language model on a smaller dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. While it won't reproduce ChatGPT, this exercise serves as an educational activity to understand the workings of these AI systems. The training process involves using a sequence of characters as input to the Transformer, which then predicts the next probable character in the sequence. 

Two files are involved in this process: one defines the model (the Transformer) and one conducts training on the specific text data set. This mention of two files—the one that trains the model on the given text data set being one of them—refers to part of the code within Nano GPT, a GitHub repository written by the author to train Transformers easily and efficiently.
