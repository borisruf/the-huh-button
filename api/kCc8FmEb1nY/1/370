This statement describes how ChatGPT works. It uses the provided initial sequence of text as a prompt, and using machine learning, it predicts and generates the rest of the sequence. So when you give it the start of a sequence (the prompt), it completes the sequence by generating a likely and contextually relevant continuation of that sequence. For instance, if you start a sentence, the AI will try to complete it in a way that makes logical and grammatical sense based on patterns it has learned from its training data.
