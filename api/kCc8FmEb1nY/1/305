In this context, "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" refers to providing an AI system (ChatGPT) with an initial input or prompt, which it then extends into a full sequence of text. The AI uses its understanding of language and patterns in text to generate a plausible continuation of the initial input. For example, if you give the system the start of a sentence or idea, it can generate the rest of the sentence or even a whole paragraph. However, since AI like ChatGPT is a probabilistic model, it can produce different outcomes for the same prompt, due to its inbuilt randomness.
