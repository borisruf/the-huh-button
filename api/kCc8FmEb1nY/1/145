The speaker is explaining that ChatGPT is a type of AI model known as a language model. It's designed to generate text that follows logically and linguistically from an input prompt. The speaker provides the beginning of a text-based sequence, such as a sentence, question, or idea. The AI then continues the sequence based on patterns it learned from vast amounts of processed data. The final result is the 'outcome', a completed text that expands upon the initial input sequence. These outcomes can vary due to the AI's probabilistic nature, which allows it to produce multiple, slightly different responses to the same input.
