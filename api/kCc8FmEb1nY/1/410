The given statement is referring to the abilities of ChatGPT, an AI language model. When it says, "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome," it means that you provide ChatGPT with a prompt or certain information and it tries to predict or generate the most likely continuation based on its learning from vast amounts of text data. It's like starting a sentence and letting the AI model finish it in a meaningful and contextually accurate way. This is utilized in various scenarios such as completing a sentence, story, poem or even writing essays and news articles, by extending the initial input sequence.
