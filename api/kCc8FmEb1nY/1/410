The text discusses the idea of building a ChatGPT-style AI using a small dataset, in this case the works of Shakespeare. The overall process involves training a Transformer (a type of neural network that originated from the paper "Attention is All You Need") on this dataset, with the end goal of having it generate 'infinite Shakespeare'. This essentially means training the AI to predict the next character in a sequence, with the hope that the output will resemble Shakespeare's style of writing.
