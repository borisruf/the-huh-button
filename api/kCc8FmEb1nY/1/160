The speaker is explaining the functionality of ChatGPT, an AI language model. They give the AI the start of a sequence, which is also known as a prompt. This could be a sentence, a question, or any string of words. The AI then completes the sequence, generating a coherent and contextually relevant text in response to the input. Because the system is probabilistic, it can yield different results for the same prompt, depending on variables such as its word choices and sentence structure.
