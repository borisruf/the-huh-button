In this passage, the term "Here, I open the 'input" refers to the speaker stating he is about to open and access the 'input' file, specifically in this case, the 'Tiny Shakespeare' text files, for processing in the code. The file is opened in order to input or load its data into the computational models he is discussing in the context. The 'input' here most likely refers to an input data stream which would be used in the time of running the code.
