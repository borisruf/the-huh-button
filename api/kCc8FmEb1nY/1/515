Andrej proposes to build out a system similar to ChatGPT, focusing primarily on training a Transformer-based language model. However, he clarifies that he won't be able to reproduce ChatGPT exactly due to its complexity and massive internet training process. Instead, he will work with a smaller dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare', which constitutes all of William Shakespeare's works. The goal is to train the Transformer to predict the progression of characters in Shakespeare's texts. By doing so, the machine can hypothetically generate Shakespeare-like language
indefinitely. Andrej will demonstrate this process using his existing GitHub repository, Nano GPT, which was designed for training Transformers on any given text. His ultimate aim is to help viewers understand how Chat GPT operates on a fundamental level. Despite the project's complexity, Andrej reassures that proficiency in Python and a basic understanding of calculus and statistics are all that's required to follow along.
