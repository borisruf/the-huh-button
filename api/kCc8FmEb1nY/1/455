This person has just given a detailed introduction to a tutorial on building a language model from scratch using Transformer architecture, with the aim of understanding what underlies the AI system ChatGPT. Key concepts mentioned include probabilistic systems, language models, the Transformer architecture, writing and training Transformer models on specific text datasets, and generating infinite text. The tutorial will involve writing the model using Python, in Google Colab, starting from an empty file and training it on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, a concatenation of all the works of Shakespeare. They've hinted at some prerequisites for following the tutorial, including proficiency in Python and basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and suggest that prior viewing of their other videos on building smaller, simpler neural networks would be beneficial. They conclude by explaining that they've already done some preliminary steps.
