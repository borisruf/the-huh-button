The speaker is explaining how OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT, works. It's designed to generate text based on a given prompt, which is the start of a sequence. The model then completes this sequence in a way that it deems most probable based on its training data, which is a large body of text in English language. It therefore generates one or multiple probable responses or completions to the given sequence. These completions are not fixed but probabilistic, meaning that if the same prompt is given again, the model might generate a different response. This system can tackle a variety of tasks like writing poems, explaining concepts, or generating news articles.
