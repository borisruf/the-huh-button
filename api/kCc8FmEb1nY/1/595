Andrej is explaining that he is going to build a Transformer-based language model from scratch using a smaller dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare.' This dataset is a compilation of all Shakespeare's works that Andrej will use as a basis to train the system to generate infinite Shakespeare like sequences. Despite not being able to replicate ChatGPT, Andrej hopes that this exercise will help the viewers understand how complex AI systems like ChatGPT work under the hood. As he moves on, he says that the only prerequisites to follow along with his exercise are having a good understanding of Python, some grounding in calculus and statistics, and having watched his previous videos in which he introduces the language modeling framework.
