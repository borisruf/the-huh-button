This is an excerpt from a lecture discussing OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) model. The narrator, having introduced GPT and the impact it has had on the AI community, moves onto explaining how it works, and talks about building one from scratch for educational purposes. They mention that it’s a language model which predicts the next word, character or token in a sequence, making it capable of generating responses or content. 

In their teaching example, the narrator proposes using a simpler dataset – in this case, a one-megabyte file called 'Tiny Shakespeare' which contains the works of Shakespeare. Using a Transformer neural network, the model would be trained to predict the next character in the sequence. This way they hope to help the audience understand how GPT works. 

They also mention a repository they've created on GitHub called Nano GPT, which provides a simple implementation of a GPT model that can be trained on any given text. The excerpt ends before the narrator starts working on the code in a Google Colab Jupyter notebook.
