In this passage, the speaker is giving an overview of how they plan to build a character level language model using a Transformer architecture. They are using a dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This set includes all the works of Shakespeare and is being used to train a language model that predicts the subsequent characters in a sequence. The model is taught to identify patterns and replicate the 'Shakespeare-like' language. For this character level model, each character in the dataset is assigned a unique integer value. This translation of characters to integers is commonly known as tokenization. The model is then trained to predict the next integer (or character) in the sequence.
