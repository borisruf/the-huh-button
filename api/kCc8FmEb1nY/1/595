In this context, the speaker is explaining how the text-to-speech AI model they are building works at a character level. This means that for each individual character in a given text or sequence, the model assigns an integer value. This process is often referred to as tokenizing, converting the raw text or string into a sequence of integers. This mapping or translation of characters to integers allows the AI model to process and understand the text. In this case, their AI model is being trained to predict what character is likely to come next in a sequence, given some context of characters from the past.
