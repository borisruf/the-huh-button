In the video, Andrej explains how ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, works. He demonstrates that ChatGPT creates responses in a sequential manner, progressing from left to right to generate a response. He stresses the fact that it is probabilistic, meaning it can provide different outputs for the same input, as he experienced when it produced two different responses to his prompt. He concludes by mentioning that there are numerous prompts that can be given to ChatGPT, with many interactions being rather humorous.
