The speaker is demonstrating a project where they have developed a simple version of a Transformer-based language model, similar to ChatGPT (though less complex). This project, accessible through their GitHub repository, has been trained on a smaller dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare' that includes all the works of Shakespeare. The speaker emphasizes that, although their language model is more simplified and trained on a much smaller dataset, it can still generate text that mimics the style of Shakespeare. They also note that using a larger dataset, such as the OpenWebText, would allow them to reproduce the performance of GPT-2, even with this simplified model.
