The speaker is explaining how ChatGPT, an AI model, works. When the speaker says, "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome", they mean that they provide an initial prompt or piece of text (the start of a sequence), and ChatGPT generates a continuation or completion of that text (the outcome), based on patterns it has learned from data. This process is the underlying functionality of many AI systems, wherein the AI uses the given input to predict or generate an appropriate output. In the context of ChatGPT, this input is often a phrase or sentence, and the output is a continuation of that input text.
