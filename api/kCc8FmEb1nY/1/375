This statement refers to the simplicity of a GitHub project called Nano GPT, developed by the speaker. It contains code to train Transformers (a type of AI model) on any given text, such as the Tiny Shakespeare dataset the speaker mentioned. The project is composed of just two scripts with 300 lines of code each, indicating that it is a simple and straightforward implementation. However, this brevity does not compromise its functionality or effectiveness as an AI training model. The idea is to keep the codebase slim and avoid unnecessary complexities, making it easier for users to understand, modify, and adapt the code for their needs. In the broader context of the discussion, the speaker is highlighting the ease with which complex AI systems like ChatGPT can be understood and even replicated using just a few hundred lines of code, thanks to the power of the Transformer architecture proposed in the 2017 paper 'Attention is all you need'.
