Andrej explains that ChatGPT is a type of AI known as a 'language model', which is designed to predict the sequence of words or characters in the English language. He details that when a starting sequence (or prompt) is provided, the AI completes the sequence with an appropriate and contextually fitting outcome. This outcome can vary each time the same prompt is asked due to the probabilistic nature of ChatGPT.
