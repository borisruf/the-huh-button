This means that user provides an initial input, or "a start of a sequence," to the AI system (in this case, ChatGPT). This input could be a sentence, phrase or even a single word. Based on this input, the AI system generates the rest of the text or "completion of sequence." The generated response by the AI is the "outcome." The technology behind AI system has learned from various data sources on how words and ideas are likely to follow the initial input, enabling it to generate a coherent and contextually suitable outcome.
