Andrej is sharing plans to build a simplified version of the ChatGPT model using a minimal dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The dataset comprises all works of Shakespeare, which is about 1MB in size. Using the Transformer neural network, Andrej aims to model the sequence of characters in Shakespeare's works, predicting the next likely characters based on a given chunk of text. His ultimate goal is to train the system to generate Shakespeare-like text, similar to how ChatGPT operates but on a character level rather than word or sub-word level. Andrej already has a GitHub repository called 'nano GPT' with the code to train these Transformers, and he plans to recreate this repository from scratch as part of the tutorial. His ultimate goal is to ensure viewers understand how the underlying mechanics of ChatGPT work. The viewers should have proficiency in Python, basic understanding of calculus and statistics, and it's also helpful if they've watched some of his previous videos. The code will be shared via a Google Colab Jupyter notebook for easy access and replication.
