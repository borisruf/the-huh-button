The speaker is introducing the process they will follow to create a simple version of the GPT language model. They have explained the structure of the model based on the landmark paper "Attention is All You Need", discussed the generative pre-training Transformer or GPT in detail as an example. They will train a Transformer-based language model character-level on a dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare', which consists of all Shakespeare's works combined into one text file. After training, the model should be able to generate a pattern of characters that mimic Shakespeare's writing style. They emphasize that this language modelling endeavor will help users understand how modern language models such as ChatGPT function. For this process, they initialised a Python code file on Google Colab and have imported the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset.
