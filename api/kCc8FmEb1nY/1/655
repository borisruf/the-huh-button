The narrator explains the technologies and processes behind the AI model ChatGPT, created by OpenAI, which generates human-like text responses. This algorithm utilizes a Transformer-based neural network model to predict the likelihood of the next word or sequence in a given context.

For example, given some text input, the Transformer model can predict the next likely word based on the preceding sequence. This was initially designed for machine translation, but has since been used in various applications in AI, including ChatGPT.

The narrator explains how OpenAI used specific tokenization principles, using Google's "sentence piece" method, which encodes sub-word units, not individual characters or entire words. This is what GPT, the model ChatGPT is based on, uses.
