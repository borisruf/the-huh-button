The speaker describes a character encoding and decoding mechanism while preparing a dataset for a language model. Here, each unique character in a text is assigned a unique integer ID. Therefore, to encode a string means to convert all the characters within that string into their corresponding integer IDs. This is achieved by creating an encoding lookup table, which assigns a unique integer to each unique character in the vocabulary. This process is then reversed to decode a sequence of integer IDs back to the original string. This is achieved by creating a decoding lookup table, mapping the integer IDs back to their respective characters. By concatenating these characters, the original string can be retrieved.
