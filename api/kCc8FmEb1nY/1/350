ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that can generate text based on the input it receives. In the context of this explanation, the idea of giving it "the start of a sequence" refers to providing ChatGPT with a prompt or initial piece of text. The system then uses this as a starting point to generate a logical and coherent continuation of the text, resulting in "completing the sequence", which is the constructed response or output of the model. The generated outcome can vary since ChatGPT is a probabilistic system, meaning it can yield different responses to the same prompt.
