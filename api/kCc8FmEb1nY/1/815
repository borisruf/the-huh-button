Andrej gives an overview of the Machine Learning System, Chat GPT. He explains that people can ask this system to perform text-based tasks, such as writing poetically about the importance of understanding AI. The system then generates a sequence of words from left to right to form a response to the given prompt. Andrej highlights that the responses can vary, depending on the probabilities of ChatGPT. He also mentions that this system is based on a 'language model', which is aware of the sequential order of words in English. Andrej then shifts his focus to the neural networking method that powers ChatGPT, the Transformer architecture, which was proposed in a 2017 paper.

Andrej acknowledges that recreating ChatGPT would be complex because of its large training size and various stages. Instead, Andrej proposes to focus on developing a Transformer-based language model at a character level using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' toy dataset. He explains that the Transformer neural network model he intends to create will predict the sequence of characters in the text of Shakespeare's works.

Further, Andrej offers a sneak peek into the system he will train, as he demonstrates the ability to generate infinite content that emulates the style of Shakespeare.

Andrej shows the code he has previously written to train Transformers, housed in a GitHub repository named Nano GPT. He reveals that Nano GPT features a simple program with just two files. One file is responsible for defining the GPT model and the Transformer, and the other file is used for training the model based on a given text dataset.

Andrej ends his discussion by sharing that heâ€™ll write the repository from scratch in a subsequent video and train it on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
