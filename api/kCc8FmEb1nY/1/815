In the context, the speaker discusses building a language model using a Transformer-based approach and using a characters tokenization scheme. Here, 'characters' means individual letters in the text. The speaker explains the process of converting raw text into a sequence of integers, a process known as tokenization. "Zero is a new line character and maybe one is a space" refers to the encoding scheme applied. In this scheme, each character in the text data set gets assigned with a corresponding integer. 'Zero' might represent a newline character ('\n') and 'One' might represent a space (' '). This translation scheme allows the model to handle and process the text data. However, the speaker isn't entirely sure if this is the case.
