In the above context, the speaker is developing a small AI project from scratch using a dataset nicknamed 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This project is intended to serve as a practical model of how larger AI systems like Chat GPT work. One of the steps of developing this model is to load the dataset into the program. When the speaker says "Here, I open the "input", he's referring to opening the dataset file for processing. 'Input' typically refers to the data fed into a system or model in computing and AI contexts.
