The speaker mentions that it's essential to keep the validation data separate during the training of their machine learning model. This is to prevent overfitting, where the model learns to repeat the specific examples it was trained on too closely, and isn't able to generalize well to new, unseen data. They want the model to learn patterns in the text, not just memorize it. In the context of training their model, the speaker reserves 90% of their data for training and retains the remaining 10% for validation to ensure that their model can generate text that is similar to, but not a carbon copy of, Shakespeare's writings.
