"In our case, character by character" refers to the way the AI model generates the text. More specifically, after being trained on a certain dataset (in this case, Shakespeare's works), the model predicts the next character in a sequence given some context from previous characters. It does this iteratively, generating sentences one character at a time. This approach is contrasted with models generating text word by word or phrase by phrase.
