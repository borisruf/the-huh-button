The phrase "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" is describing the function of language models like ChatGPT. The "start of a sequence" is a text prompt which serves as the input to the AI model. The AI model, then processes this input and generates a text response which is "the outcome". Thus, the model is essentially "completing the sequence" by providing a continuation of the initial text it received in a syntactically and semantically valid manner according to its training.
