The speaker is discussing a demonstration of creating a character-level language model based on the Transformer architecture, which can generate text one character at a time. The exercise involves a dataset containing the entire works of Shakespeare, referred to as the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. The intent is to train the model on this dataset, so that it learns how characters and words typically follow each other in Shakespeare's works. After training, the model should be able to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing by predicting what character is likely to come next, based on the context of characters that have been provided to it. The speaker notes that this model creates text in a similar way to related AI models like ChatGPT, albeit on a simpler and smaller scale.
