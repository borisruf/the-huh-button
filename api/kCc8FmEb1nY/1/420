The speaker discusses what ChatGPT is and how it works. Powered by a system called Transformer, from the paper "Attention is All You Need", ChatGPT is a language model based on AI that performs tasks given through text prompts. Though it may generate different answers for the same prompt, it is capable of creating quite sophisticated and contextually relevant outputs. The speaker then delves into understanding the Transformer, discussing how it was developed as a machine translation tool but later appropriated for wider AI applications. The core of this discussion is to familiarize the audience with the inner workings of ChatGPT, which the speaker chooses to do by building a similar language model using 'Tiny Shakespeare', a dataset. He will train a Transformer-based language model using the characters in the works of Shakespeare to predict what comes next in the sequence. He refers to a GitHub repository called 'Nano GPT', which shows how one can train Transformers. The speaker's ultimate intent is to provide an understanding and appreciation of how Chat GPT's complex neural actions function.
