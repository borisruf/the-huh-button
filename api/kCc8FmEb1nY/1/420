The speaker is describing how ChatGPT works. ChatGPT is an AI model that can generate text by modelling the sequence of words, characters, or tokens. When given the start of a sequence or a specific prompt, it completes the sequence by generating the rest of the text. This is a probabilistic system, meaning that there can be multiple possible outputs for any given input. This makes it capable of creating diverse and often creative text responses. To illustrate, the speaker provided various prompts like "Please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree" and explained how ChatGPT can generate different but relevant responses to these prompts.
