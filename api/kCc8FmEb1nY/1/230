The speaker is discussing the concept and workings of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art AI system that responds to human text-based prompts with a diverse array of answers. The speaker mentioned the unpredictability of the responses, demonstrating the probabilistic nature of the AI. The speaker then discussed the Transformer architecture, a critical component in AI, especially in language models like ChatGPT. To further demonstrate the capabilities of Transformer-based language models, the speaker explains the plan to create a character-level language model using a dataset called "Tiny Shakespeare," which is a consolidation of all of Shakespeare's works.
