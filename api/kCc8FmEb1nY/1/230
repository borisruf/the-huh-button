In the context above, the speaker is discussing training a character-level language model using Transformer architecture, similar to how the AI program ChatGPT works. However, they clarify that they will not be able to replicate ChatGPT, as it is a complex system trained on vast amounts of data from the internet. They state that "we need a smaller data set", which means that they will be using a reduced or more manageable amount of training data to create their model. A smaller dataset is easier to manage and handle, making it a good choice for educational or experimental purposes, especially when resources are limited.
