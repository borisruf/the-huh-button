The speaker is describing how the ChatGPT system works. When he says, "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome," he means that he provides an initial input or prompt (start of a sequence), which might be a question or a topic, and the AI (ChatGPT) responds by generating a continuation or completion of that sequence of words. The 'outcome' here refers to the text generated by the AI based on the provided prompt. Thus, what he simply means is that he gives the AI a beginning, and the AI provides the ending.
