The AI technology mentioned in this context, ChatGPT, works by completing sequences given by the user. When the user inputs the start of a sequence, or a "prompt", ChatGPT generates a completion based on patterns it has learned from extensive training on diverse examples of English text. The system understands the sequence of words in a particular language (in this case, English) and predicts how the sequence will progress given the initial input or prompt. Therefore, when the speaker says 'I give it the start of a sequence and it completes the sequence', this refers to the way the AI takes a user-provided text as a starting point and then generates a suitable continuation, like creating a poem, generating an article, or even making humorous responses.
