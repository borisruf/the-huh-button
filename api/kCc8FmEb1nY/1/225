"Tiny Shakespeare" refers to a much smaller and simpler dataset compared to the vast amount of information available on the internet. This dataset is significantly easier to work with, especially for demonstrating or experimenting with AI and machine learning concepts, hence the term 'toy dataset'. In this case, it's being used to train a Transformer-based language model, which is a simpler version of how the AI model ChatGPT works. As the name suggests, "Tiny Shakespeare" contains a fraction of the works of William Shakespeare, making it ideal for training language models due to the rich and nuanced use of language in his works.
