The phrase "ChatGPT went from left to right and generated all these words sequentially" describes the process used by ChatGPT to construct a sentence or text. This is called autoregression. It means that when generating a new text, the AI starts from the first word (left side of the sentence) and moves to the end of the sentence (right side), selecting the next word based on the current and preceding words. The output is the sequence of predicted words that compose the entire text.
