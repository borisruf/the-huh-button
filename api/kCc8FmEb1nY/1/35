ChatGPT uses an autoregressive model, which means it generates predictions one step at a time and uses its own previous outputs as inputs for future predictions. In the given context, when it says "ChatGPT went from left to right and generated all these words sequentially," it refers to this autoregressive behavior. The model started generating words from the left (the beginning of the sentence) and moved along to the right (the end of the sentence). After generating each word, it used that as context for predicting the following word, until it had completed the entire sentence or poem.
