The instructor in this text is explaining about the workings of the Chat GPT system and how it generates responses to various prompts. He discusses the key paper "Attention is All You Need", which provided the Transformer model that powers GPT. He then suggests a practical project: to implement a simpler version of GPT that predicts character sequences in a set of Shakespeare's works. After discussing necessary preparations like tokenization and encoding, he makes clear that his code is simply an illustrative example and other encoding schemes exist. In the end, he introduces the Tick Token library, a byte-pair encoding tokenizer used by GPT.
