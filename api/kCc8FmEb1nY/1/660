Andrej plans to reproduce ChatGPT's functions on a simpler level using a smaller dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. This dataset compiles all of Shakespeare's works into one file. By training a Transformer-based language model on this dataset, the system can be taught to predict and generate sequences that are similar in structure to Shakespeare's writing. While it can't replicate full-scale production-level systems like ChatGPT, this simplified model may be used to enhance one's understanding of how Chat GPT fundamentally works.
