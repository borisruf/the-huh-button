In this context, the speaker is describing the process of using a transformer neural network to predict the next character in a sequence from a text. They are using a subset of Shakespeare's works as an example. In the example, a set of characters is highlighted within this text, and the transformer neural network is then tasked with predicting what the next likely character might be based upon the given string of characters. This is a simplified explanation of how language models like ChatGPT work - they analyze given text and then predict what word, phrase or, in this case, character is likely to follow based on patterns they have learned during training.
