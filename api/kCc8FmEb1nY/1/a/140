The neural network under the hood of ChatGPT is a type of architecture called the Transformer. The Transformer model, introduced by a paper called "Attention is All You Need", has become a widely-used model in natural language processing tasks. It utilizes a mechanism called 'attention' to weigh the influence of different words in the input sequence when producing an output, giving it a strong ability to handle long-range dependencies in language. These Transformer-based networks are trained on large corpora of text data and learn to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous ones. The specific implementation of ChatGPT uses a variant of these Transformer models known as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), developed by OpenAI. It uses unsupervised learning and can generate a sequence of words from a given prompt, making it particularly suited for task like text generation, translation, summarization, and dialogue.
