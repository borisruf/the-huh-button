The speaker is discussing the concept of ChatGPT, a language model that can generate human-like text based on prompts given to it. He then goes on to explain the Transformer architecture, which is the underlying neural network that enables ChatGPT to function. To provide a hands-on understanding of how this works, the speaker introduces a project to build a character-level language model using the Transformer architecture, which will be trained on text from Shakespeare's works. This model, referred to as 'Nano GPT', aims to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's style. The speaker mentions that the code for this project is available in a GitHub repository.
