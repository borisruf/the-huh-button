The given text explains the process of building a chatbot that uses the Transformer model, which is a machine learning model that is used to understand sequences of data, such as language. The author, aiming to investigate how the Transformer model works in applications like ChatGPT, decides to create a simpler version of the system.

The first step is creating a character-level language model by taking the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, which is a dataset containing all of Shakespeare's works in one file. The intention is to train the model to predict the most likely next character based on the previous ones in the text.

To carry out this operation, the program needs to process the text at a character level and convert it to a numerical format that the model can understand. This translates each unique character into a unique number, resulting in what is called a "vocabulary" for the model. 

The tokenization process is two-fold. There's an "encode" operation, which translates a string of characters to corresponding numerical values (or "tokens"). And there's a "decode" function, which translates these tokens back into the original string. 

In the code, two translations tables are made, one for going from characters to integers, and one for going back from integers to characters. With these functions, the system can interpret and work with the text data in a form that the machine learning model can process.
