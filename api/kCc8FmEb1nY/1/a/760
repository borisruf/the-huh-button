In this passage, the speaker discusses the concept of a character level tokenizer in the context of a language model. This model is designed to work with individual characters rather than whole words or phrases. The speaker argues that while there are many ways to implement this kind of model, it's best to keep the implementation simple, especially for purposes of demonstration and teaching. In this case, the language model is being trained on a dataset containing all the works of Shakespeare, in order to generate text that sounds like Shakespeare. The tokenizer translates individual characters into integers for processing, and then back into characters for output. It does this using a lookup table built from all the characters in the dataset. While this implementation uses a simple character-level tokenizer, others might use more complex tokenizers that work on larger chunks of text, such as words or sub-word units. Although these can be more efficient, they can also be harder to understand and implement.
