This statement explains the way in which ChatGPT produces text. It does this by creating one word after the other, from left to right, in a linear and orderly way. This is similar to how humans write, starting from the beginning of a sentence and moving to the end. The sentence's natural flow as well as its syntactic and logical coherence is maintained by this sequential manner of text generation.
