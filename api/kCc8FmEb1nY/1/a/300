The speaker discusses training a simplified version of the ChatGPT AI model using a small dataset known as 'Tiny Shakespeare' which contains all of Shakespeare's works. The model, a character-level Transformer-based language model, predicts the next character in a sequence based on previously provided characters. After training, the model can generate text that resembles Shakespeare. However, the speaker emphasizes that this generated text, although it appears Shakespearean, is artificially constructed and not genuine Shakespeare.
