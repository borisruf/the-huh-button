A tensor in the PyTorch library is a multi-dimensional array with a uniform type (i.e., integer, float, complex, etc.). In essential, it is an n-dimensional matrix. It can be located on different devices and can provide a lot of powerful functionalities like easy mathematical operations, efficient slicing among other things. It is a generalization of scalars, vectors, matrices, or arrays of more than three dimensions, which are essential parts in the computations in neural networks so the tensor serves as the main data structure in PyTorch.
