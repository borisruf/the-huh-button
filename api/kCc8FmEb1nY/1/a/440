The speaker is discussing the functionality of a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence program known as "ChatGPT". The speaker remarks that the program, which operates using an AI model called generative pre-training transformer, is capable of generating text in a variety of forms based on user prompts. 

The speaker goes into detail about his desire to build a unique transformer-based language model and how to apply it on a convenient dataset, such as "Tiny Shakespeare". The speaker encourages this approach for experimental purposes, noting that it can be easily replicated with any text data set for different outcomes. 

Essentially, the speaker is explaining that one can develop a similar machine learning model and train it with any chosen text data. Such a model would then generate outputs based on the trained text, potentially mimicking the style or content of the source text. This understanding is represented by the final line, "â€¦this can copy-paste to any arbitrary text data set that you like".
