ChatGPT is a type of AI that uses language models to create responses to user prompts. The term "probabilistic" refers to the AI's ability to produce different responses to the same prompt due to the algorithms and models it uses to generate its responses. These models take into account many factors and variables, so the same prompt can yield different responses each time, showcasing the system's versatility and wide range of possible outcomes.
