In the given context, when the speaker says "So for example, 46, 47, etc.", they're referring to the encoding of the text "hi there". This encoding is the numerical representation of that string, where individual characters are converted into integers. This is crucial for the tokenization process to provide an input that the AI model can work with. As a character-level language model, every character from "hi there" is represented by a corresponding integer in the sequence.
