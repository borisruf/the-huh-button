"Tokenizing" is the process of converting the raw text, which is a string, into a sequence of integers. This process is based on a specific vocabulary of possible elements. This is done according to a specific list or notation. In other words, it involves breaking down the text into smaller units (tokens), such as words or characters, and assigning each an integer identifier. This allows machine learning algorithms, like language models, to process and understand the text more effectively by transforming it into a format they can manipulate. In this context, the vocabulary consists of the set of unique words or characters that appear in the text.
