The speaker is providing an explanation of the foundational elements used in a language-based AI model called ChatGPT, specifically the Transformer neural network model. He explains how the model is trained to predict the next character in a sequence based on given previous characters, using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset as an example. After the model sees a number of characters, it predicts the next likely character this continues until a full word or sentence is formed. The system then doesn't just model words in a sentence, but every individual character in the text file, including spaces and special characters.
