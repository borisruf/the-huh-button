This explanation is about how a Transformer-based language model can be trained to generate text in a certain style, in this case Shakespeare style, using a data set called Tiny Shakespeare. When given the start of a sequence of characters, the model predicts the next one based on the patterns it has learned. The system scans a sequence of characters and predicts what might come next based on its training. Once trained, it can generate an infinite amount of text in that same style. This is similar to how the AI language model ChatGPT works, though this example operates on a character level instead of token- or word chunk-level. The lecturer's plan is to create a Transformer and train it from scratch using Python, with the goal of generating Shakespearean-style text.
