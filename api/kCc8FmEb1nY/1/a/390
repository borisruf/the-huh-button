GPT2 refers to the second generation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer model developed by OpenAI. This model, which was a predecessor to the current ChatGPT, is based on the Transformer architecture proposed in a 2017 paper titled "Attention is all you need." The model is trained to predict the next word or character in a sentence, allowing it to generate human-like text. This makes it useful for applications such as chatbots, translation, and even creative writing. The speaker refers to GPT2 as an early version, suggesting they're comparing it to later models like GPT-3 or ChatGPT, which have larger architectures and are trained on larger datasets.
