The speaker provides an explanation of how the AI known as ChatGPT works, explaining it as a 'language model' that is capable of predicting and generating sequences of words or characters in response to a given prompt. They make mention of the underlying 'Transformer' architecture that is the basis of ChatGPT, which originating from a 2017 paper titled 'Attention is all you need'. 

The speaker then proceeds to explain their ambition to create similar, Transformer-based language model using a smaller data set called 'Tiny Shakespeare' as a learning tool, which contains all of the works of Shakespeare. The goal is to predict how characters or tokens will follow each other in sequence, creating faux-Shakespeare text.

Finally, the speaker refers to their own GitHub repository, Nano GPT, which contains all the necessary code to carry out this task. The implementation, albeit simple in nature, can successfully reproduce the performance of GPT2, an early version of GPT from OpenAI, when trained on a suitably large dataset. The speaker encourages the audience to examine the code for themselves.
