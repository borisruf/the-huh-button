The 'tick token' library is a tool specific to NLP (Natural Language Processing) that is used to encode and decode texts. In the given example, encoding allows you to convert raw texts, like a string "hi there", into a list of integers. And, decoding lets you translate that list of integers back into the original string of text. This is particularly useful when training language models like GPT for parsing and understanding texts. The library supports different forms of Tokenization methods. For instance, encoding at a character level (as shown in the example), sub-word level (used by Google's 'sentence piece') or word level. This essentially means breaking down the input text into respective units (characters, sub-words, or words) and encoding them into integers which can be processed by the model. 'Tick token' uses Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer, which has proven to be effective in many NLP applications like ChatGPT from OpenAI.
