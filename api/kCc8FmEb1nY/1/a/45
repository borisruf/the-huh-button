This indicates that ChatGPT doesn't always generate the exact same responses to a given input. It can produce a variety of answers depending on its model configuration and other factors. This is due to its random nature at prediction time. Essentially, when the model is generating text, it has multiple potential options it could formulate for the following word or phrase, and it selects among these based on a probability distribution. This is what leads to the variation in responses even with identical prompts.
