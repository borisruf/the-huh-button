The person in the context is explaining how to create a language model using a Transformer architecture based on the ChatGPT model, which is a type of AI that completes text-based tasks. They explain that ChatGPT can generate different outcomes from the same prompt by predicting how words follow each other in the English language. As an example, they demonstrate how to train a character-level language model on a small dataset called Tiny Shakespeare, where the Transformer predicts which character is likely to come next given some characters in the past. The person also provides an example of the generated language, which imitates Shakespeareâ€™s writing style, and he mentions that the training code can be found on his Github repository called Nano GPT.
