The speaker is providing an insight into the manner in which AI systems, such as ChatGPT, function and generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses. These systems are trained on large datasets and then presented with a "prompt" or a given text, which they use as a starting point to complete a sequence in a conversational manner. The speaker intends to demonstrate this process by using a small-scale, 'character-level language model' trained on a dataset comprising the works of Shakespeare. The aim is to predict the next character that follows a given sequence of characters, based on the patterns observed within Shakespeare's writings as a data set. The speaker will preview this model once it has been trained.
