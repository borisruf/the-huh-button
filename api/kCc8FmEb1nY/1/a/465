The speaker is introducing a code repository project, where they intend to build a smaller version of the transformer model from scratch, similar to ChatGPT. Transformers are high-performing machine learning models primarily used for understanding sequences, such as strings of text. The speaker aims to train this model on Shakespeare's works alone, creating a tool that can generate infinite, Shakespearean-style text. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the underpinnings of how ChatGPT and similar AI language models work. Supplementary knowledge in Python coding, statistics and calculus is beneficial for understanding the project's complexities. Finally, they mention their 'Make More' series for foundational knowledge regarding simpler neural network language models.
