The mentioned 'process' refers to the training of a transformer-based language model. When the presenter speaks of modelling "all the patterns inside this data", they mean the AI learning the style, vocabulary, sequences and structure in Shakespeare's works. As the transformer model is trained on Shakespeare's text, it analyses how each character, word and sentence within the text progresses. It then uses this understanding to predict the next character in a sequence. Thus, in essence, the AI becomes a form of 'Shakespeare emulator', capable of generating text that closely emulates the style of Shakespeare because it has modelled the patterns of his writing.
