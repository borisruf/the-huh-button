GPT stands for 'generally pre-trained Transformer', and it's essentially the foundational model that powers systems like ChatGPT. The 'Transformer' part of the name comes from a groundbreaking research paper in artificial intelligence called 'Attention is all you need', which proposed the Transformer architecture for language modeling. This architecture enables the system to understand and generate language based on the sequence of words, characters, or more generally, tokens. The 'pre-trained' aspect means that the model has been previously trained on large amounts of text data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually accurate responses. This is the underlying mechanism that allows ChatGPT to complete prompts with diverse and often contextually relevant responses.
