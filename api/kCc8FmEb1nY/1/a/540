The phrase in question is basically describing the process of converting a large continuous string of text (in this case, the works of Shakespeare) into a list of unique characters, sorted in alphabetical order. This is done by calling the 'set' constructor on the text, which takes all the unique elements and forms a set out of them, this helps to eliminate any repeated occurrences of the same character. The 'list' constructor is then called on this set to convert it into a list, providing an ordered sequence, and then it is sorted in alphabetical order. In the context of building a character-level language model, this would be a preliminary step to encode the data for training a machine learning model, which generally expects numerical data.
