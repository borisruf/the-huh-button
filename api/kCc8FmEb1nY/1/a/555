The speaker is explaining how a particular type of Transformer neural network model works, specifically using the ChatGPT as an example. The explanation includes an understanding of the background of the Transformer, the ability to generate language, its probabilistic properties, and its applications in AI. The focus then shifts to a demonstration of implementing a Transformer-based language model and training it to predict sequences of characters based on data from a body of text - in this case, the works of Shakespeare. The speaker explains that this type of AI models how words follow each other in a language. The reference to the number 65 indicates the total number of unique characters found in the Shakespeare text being used, illustrating the model's 'vocabulary' from which it makes its predictions.
