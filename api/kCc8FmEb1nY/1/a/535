In Python, text is treated as a sequence of characters, each identified by its unique position in the text. Depending on the number of unique characters in the text, Python can, in a way, convert these characters into numbers, as each unique character can be associated with a unique number. This is particularly useful in situations like language modelling, as illustrated in the article. The author's goal is to train a Transformer-based language model to generate text that emulates the writing style of Shakespeare, by learning the patterns of character sequences in Shakespeare's works. 

In essence, Python will feed chunks of text (sequences of characters) into the Transformer, which will then predict the next character in the sequence based on what it has learnt from the training process. These predicted characters can then be strung together to form new sentences that are "Shakespeare-like".
