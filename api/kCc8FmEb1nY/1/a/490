The speaker has introduced the ChatGPT system, a probabilistic system or 'language model' that can generate responses to text-based tasks or prompts. He also mentioned that it utilizes the Transformer architecture, a landmark in AI proposed in 2017. To better illustrate its mechanics and feasibility, the speaker aims to create a simple implementation of a Transformer language model, using a small data set called Tiny Shakespeare for training. This demonstration is to provide a clearer understanding of how ChatGPT works. The speaker also mentioned that the code to accomplish this has already been written and can be found in his GitHub repository named ‘Nano GPT.’ The speaker then indicates that he will guide the audience in re-creating the repository from scratch.
