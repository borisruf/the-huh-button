The person is explaining how language modelling works with AI, specifically using GPT (Generally Pre-Trained Transformer) and how it generates text based on given prompts. It is a complex, multi-stage process requiring an extensive training on a robust database to catch the nuances of language and produce coherent responses. To simplify the process for instructional purposes, they describe building a similar, but simpler model using a 'character-level language model', trained on a data set named Tiny Shakespeare. This makes it possible to predict the sequence of characters in a Shakespeare-like language. The goal is to provide a practical understanding of how ChatGPT operates and the fundamentals involved in building a model like this with Python and basic calculus & statistics knowledge. The model works by translating individual characters into integers based on a vocabulary of possible elements and learning the probability of different sequences. The character-to-integer translation is done through a process called tokenization, using a library called 'tick token' in the example.
