The neural network under the hood that models the sequence of these words in ChatGPT is a transformer-based model specifically, the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model developed by OpenAI. The GPT model utilizes the architecture of a transformer-based network, which includes the use of attention mechanisms to better understand the context and relationship between words in a sequence. It is trained to predict the likelihood of a word given the previous words used in a text, enabling it to generate text that is relevant and makes sense. It is a machine learning technique for natural language processing and is the core of ChatGPT's text generation capability.
