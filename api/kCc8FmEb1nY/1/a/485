The speaker in this context is preparing to present a demonstration on how the neural network architecture of ChatGPT, a conversationally skilled AI model, operates. ChatGPT is a language model, meaning it models the sequence of words or characters. He explains how different prompts can elicit a variety of generated responses from the AI. The speaker then elaborates on the fundamentals of how ChatGPT works, discussing its origin from the 2017 paper, 'Attention is all you need,' which proposed the Transformer Architecture, the model at the heart of ChatGPT. In the demonstration, data from Shakespeare's works will be used as a simpler alternative to the internet-sized libraries that professional models like ChatGPT are trained on. The code used for this demonstration will later be available for access and use via a link in the video description.
