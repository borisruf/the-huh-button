The speaker is suggesting that the authors of the 2017 paper 'Attention is all you need' – which proposed the Transformer neural network architecture – possibly did not foresee how influential and transformative their proposal would be to the field of AI. The Transformer model has proven to be an integral component in powering next-generation language models like ChatGPT. The speaker infers that the possibly unexpected extensive application and evolution of the Transformer architecture may not reflect the originally intended focus of the paper, which appeared to be primarily about machine translation.
