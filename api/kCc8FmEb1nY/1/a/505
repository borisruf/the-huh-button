In this excerpt, the speaker explains the functionality and capabilities of a model called ChatGPT, which is used to carry out text-based tasks in an interactive manner, utilizing AI. The speaker describes the model as a probabilistic system, emphasizing that given the same prompt, the response may vary on different attempts.

The speaker goes on to discuss the architecture that powers ChatGPT. GPT stands for 'generally pre-trained Transformer', a neural network system born from the landmark paper, 'Attention is all you need', published in 2017. This architecture has been influential in AI and is the primary driver behind ChatGPT.

However, the speaker acknowledges that reproducing a system like ChatGPT in its entirety is complex. Instead, the focus will be on training a Transformer-based, character-level language model using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. This model will practice predicting the next character in a string of text based on the data from Shakespeare's works, mimicking the style of the original text.

The speaker also makes reference to a GitHub repository, 'Nano GPT', which contains code for training Transformers and has been used to successfully reproduce the performance of GPT2, an earlier version of GPT. Finally, the speaker explains that the following tutorial will guide the user in coding the repository from scratch using a new Google collab or Jupyter Notebook, starting with loading the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset and reading in the text as a string.
