In ChatGPT, "coming out on the token by token level" means that the AI system generates responses one word or piece at a time, in a sequential manner. In this context, a 'token' can be as small as a character or an entire word. The AI analyses the input and predicts what the next word would be based on the previously generated sequence. This process continues until a full response is generated. Hence, the text is produced on a 'token-by-token' basis.
