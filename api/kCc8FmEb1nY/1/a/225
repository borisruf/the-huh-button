Character-level language model is the type of language model where the system generates predictions based on individual characters rather than on words. It predicts the next character within a sequence of characters given in the input. The advantage of a character-level model is that it can generate entirely new words that it has never seen in the training set. It can also better handle languages where the concept of a 'word' might not be as clearly defined. The phrase “character-level” in the context above refers to a simplified version of a Transformer-based language model that the speaker plans to build, which will focus on predicting characters rather than words or other larger units of language.
