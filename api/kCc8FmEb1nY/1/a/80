ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, generates text based responses to given prompts. It computes its responses in a sequential, left-to-right manner. Given the same prompt, it can produce a variety of different but relevant responses due to its probabilistic nature. This can be exemplified with the varied results from a prompt asking ChatGPT to write a haiku about the value of understanding AI. Users respond to this feature by crafting unique and often humorous prompts of their own, with websites compiling these interactions.
