This portion of the discussion is about using an AI system (like ChatGPT) to create what's known as a 'character-level language model'. This essentially means creating a model that understands and uses the likely pattern of characters following each other in a given language - in this case, English. In the given context, the instructor is using all the works of Shakespeare as the data set for the model. The goal is to have the AI model learn and understand the pattern of how characters (letters, not people) follow each other in Shakespearean English, thereby "modeling" the language.
