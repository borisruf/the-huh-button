In this context, the speaker is explaining a technical process of machine learning and training AI on a database, which they demonstrate by using an AI system to generate text in the style of Shakespeare. The speaker apologizes for any "junk," or perhaps errors and inaccuracies, in the AI-generated text that they were not able to fix or "resolve." These inconsistencies or oddities may be due to the programming or the AI's interpretation of the data, since its understanding and processing of language can differ from human perception and semantics.
