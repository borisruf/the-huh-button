A sentence piece is a form of subword linguistics modeling method used by Google for tasks that involve processing a lot of text data. In essence, it chops up words into smaller parts, which make it more efficient to handle words that are not present in the dictionary. Like other tokenization methods, it converts text strings into number sequences that a machine like a neural network or AI model can work with. But unlike character level modeling, where each character is separately treated, it considers multiple characters or strings as one token and makes the tokenization more efficient in handling complex or rare words.
