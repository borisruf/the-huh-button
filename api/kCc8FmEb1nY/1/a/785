PyTorch's tensor is a key abstraction in deep learning libraries that is used to efficiently compute and store multi-dimensional arrays of numbers. It functions similar to arrays and matrices in NumPy, but it can also be used on a GPU to accelerate computing. 

Tensors are used to encapsulate the inputs, outputs, and parameters of a model, as well as the internal variables. It's essentially the PyTorch version of a NumPy array, but unlike NumPy, PyTorch tensors can utilize GPUs to accelerate their numeric computations.

In the context of the discussion with ChatGPT and Tiny Shakespeare, the tutor uses tensor to convert the entire dataset of Shakespeare's work into a numerical form - specifically, using the torch.tensor function, because they'll be modelling the sequences using a Transformer neural network, which requires numerical input data.
