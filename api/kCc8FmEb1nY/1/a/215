The speaker is explaining the mechanism behind ChatGPT, a type of artificial intelligence that can generate a multitude of responses to a given prompt. Essentially, it's a language model that uses a particular type of neural network called a Transformer to understand and generate sequences of words. The speaker acknowledges that rebuilding something like chatgpt is beyond the scope of their talk as it involves a complex combination of phases including training with large amounts of data, pre-training, and fine-tuning.
