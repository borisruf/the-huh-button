In this context, the speaker is using a machine learning model based on the Transformer architecture to predict the next character in a sequence of text from Shakespeare's works. The model views the highlighted text and predicts that the letter 'g' would most likely follow. This prediction is based on the model's training on a dataset containing a substantial part of the Internet, which allows it to understand the patterns and probabilities of character sequences in English text. Renowned for its efficiency in dealing with sequential data, the Transformer model is the architecture upon which the ChatGPT AI system, a text generating tool, is built. Overall, the prediction is part of an endeavour to illustrate the functionality and power of a 'character-level language model'.
