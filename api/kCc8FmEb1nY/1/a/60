The speaker explains how ChatGPT, an AI system, works. They mention that you can give the system text-based tasks, such as writing a haiku about the importance of understanding AI to improve the world. The speaker runs the AI and presents two different responses generated by the system to the same prompt indicating that ChatGPT is probabilistic, meaning it can provide multiple different responses to a single prompt. The phrase "Now, this is just one example of a prompt" suggests that there are numerous possible prompts for interaction with the system.
