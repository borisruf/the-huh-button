The explanation is related to the workings of a language model like ChatGPT. The speaker describes how ChatGPT analyzes and generates text in a sequential manner. The focus then shifts to how such language models translate input text into numerical representations for computation purposes, which is termed tokenization. Given the model's character-level analysis, tokenization involves assigning each unique character in the text a unique integer. Thus, a sentence or piece of text is converted into a sequence of integers. This conversion is done both ways - text to integers and integers back to text - for processing and generating human-readable outputs respectively.
