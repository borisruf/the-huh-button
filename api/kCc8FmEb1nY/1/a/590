The explanation given involves a concept in natural language processing known as tokenization. In this context, tokenization refers to the process of converting text into discrete units or 'tokens', which can be individual words or subwords. In this case, the text is converted into a sequence of integers where each unique character or 'token' in the text is assigned a unique integer value. This conversion or mapping is according to a specific vocabulary of possible tokens. The mapping makes it easier to process and analyze the text for tasks such as language modeling or text generation, which is what ChatGPT, the AI model discussed in the context, is used for. The notion of 'tokenization' is employed in many areas of AI, particularly in natural language processing and machine learning, to simplify the input for machine learning models.
