'Sentence piece' tokenization, used by Google, converts a piece of text into integer representations, similar to character-level tokenization. However, compared to character-level tokenization that converts individual characters into integers, 'sentence piece' adopts a different approach. It tokenizes the text using a different vocabulary set and schema, often breaking down the text into meaningful subword units. This method of tokenization gives preference to common phrases that appear more frequently in the text, treating them as single tokens, and breaking down less frequent phrases into smaller tokens. This approach helps maintain a balance between the flexibility of character-level tokenization and the efficiency of word-level tokenization.
