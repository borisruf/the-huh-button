In his explanation, the author is demonstrating how a character-level language model works. This type of model is trained to predict the next character in a sequence based on the characters it has seen so far. The author uses the works of Shakespeare as training data for this model. After the model is trained, it generates outputs that are similar to Shakespeare's writing style. Each character it predicts is influenced by the characters that came before it, resulting in sequences of characters that match the patterns found in the training data.
