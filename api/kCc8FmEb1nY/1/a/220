The context is a monologue introducing the workings of the ChatGPT system, an AI that interacts with humans based on text prompts and can produce creatively unique responses. The speaker explains that ChatGPT is a probabilistic system that employs a Transformer-based language model, a technology developed from a groundbreaking AI paper titled 'Attention is all you need'. This language model allows the AI to predict and generate sequences of words in a coherent and contextually accurate manner. Looking to delve into the technical aspects behind the system, the speaker aims to train a smaller-scale version of a Transformer-based language model similar to the one that powers the function of ChatGPT.
