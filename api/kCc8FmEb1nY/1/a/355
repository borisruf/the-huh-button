Nano GPT is a smaller-scale version of the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) utilized for OpenAI's ChatGPT. Rather than being trained on a vast amount of the internet like ChatGPT, Nano GPT is trained on a smaller data set called Tiny Shakespeare, which contains all of the works of Shakespeare in one file. The goal of Nano GPT is to predict the next character in a sequence, modeling the flow and patterns of Shakespeare's writing. The code for this Transformer-based language model has been written and stored in a GitHub repository for access and use.
