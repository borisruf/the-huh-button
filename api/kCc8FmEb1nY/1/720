In this bit, the speaker describes how ChatGPT (an AI-based language model developed by OpenAI) functions and generates responses. He explains that for any given prompt, the system stochastically generates multiple possible responses. The underlying architecture of ChatGPT is based on a 2017 AI paper's findings, which introduced the Transformer model. The speaker then explains how they seek to create a simpler, educational model based on this Transformer framework using Python and rudimentary calculus and statistics. The speaker also details the process of tokenization where raw text data is converted into a sequence of integers.
