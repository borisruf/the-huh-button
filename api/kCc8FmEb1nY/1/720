The phrase "Here, I open the "input" signifies the initiation of a data handling operation in which the narrator is getting ready to read data from a particular sourceâ€”in this case, the "Tiny Shakespeare" data set. This action is often the first step in training a machine learning model, where opening the data source means loading the data or preparing the data file for processing or reading. In the context, the expression is effectively serving to transition from the conceptual overview of GPT and Transformer architecture to the programming or implementation phase.
