In this context, the statement "And so it's very complicated" serves to sum up a long explanation about the inner workings of ChatGPT AI. The speaker mentioned earlier that the system is a "very serious production-grade system" and requires a large dataset (a good chunk of the internet) as well as complex procedures like pre-training and fine-tuning. Therefore, when the speaker concludes, "And so it's very complicated", they mean that building a model like ChatGPT is a complex task that is not easily reproduced due to the sophisticated architecture, huge amount of data, and the complex training involved.
