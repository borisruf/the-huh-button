The speaker is explaining how the ChatGPT system, a type of Artificial Intelligence, is used to generate text in a sequence. When the system is given a starting prompt, it completes it by generating the rest of the sequence, based on its understanding of the English language and the context. The system works in a way that can yield multiple outcomes for the same prompt, based on its probabilistic nature. The final output or completion depends on how the AI models the sequence of words, characters, or tokens, based on the starting sequence or prompt provided to it.
