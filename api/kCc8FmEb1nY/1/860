Andrej is an AI expert who is creating an educational video about ChatGPT and the Transformer neural network that powers it. After explaining how ChatGPT works as a language model, he presents his plan to build a simplified version of it, training a character-level language model on a small dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. Andrej demonstrates the capability of generating 'Shakespeare-like' language sequences using this model. He also directs viewers to his GitHub repository called 'Nano GPT', which contains the coding files for training Transformers. In these files, he successfully reproduces the performance of GPT-2, an additional validation of his methodology. His end goal is to help viewers understand ChatGPT's operational dynamics, assuming they have some background in Python, calculus, statistics, and familiarity with his previous videos. To aid viewers' understanding, Andrej proceeds to write the repository from scratch in a new Google Colab Jupyter notebook that will also be shared with viewers, so they can follow along.
