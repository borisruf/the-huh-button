The speaker in the context is setting up to share coding instruction for creating a Transformer-based language model, which is the underlying neural network that powers systems like ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate text. To simplify the process, he uses a toy dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare', which contains all the works of Shakespeare. The goal is to train the Transformer neural network to predict the next character in a sequence from Shakespeare's texts. This model will then be capable of generating an endless string of 'Shakespeare-like' language. The instruction is expected to be shared via a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab for others to follow along. The "input" referred to at the end is likely a file the speaker opens for demonstration purposes.
