The speaker is describing how ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, is capable of generating creative, contextually relevant responses to text prompts. They introduce the conceptual machine-learning model known as the Transformer, which is the underlying technology for neural networks like GPT. The Transformer, proposed in a 2017 paper called "Attention is All You Need," has been adapted and used in many AI applications. The speaker intends to demonstrate the inner workings of these models by creating a simpler, character-level language model using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. They talk about converting raw text into sequences of numerical tokens which can be processed by the model and then decoded back into text.
