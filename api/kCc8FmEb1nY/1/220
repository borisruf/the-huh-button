Andrej explained that ChatGPT, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) program, is what's referred to as a 'language model'. He qualified it as such because it models sequences of words, characters, or tokens. It operates based on how words succeed each other in the English language. Andrej further explained that the task of ChatGPT, from its perspective, is to complete a given sequence. When provided with the beginning of a sequence, it is programmed to determine and generate a suitable outcome.
