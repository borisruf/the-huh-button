"We need a smaller dataset in this case" means that in the context of attempting to replicate or understand the workings of the Chat GPT AI, it isn't necessary to use the vast quantity of data that the original system was trained on. Instead, a more focused and manageable amount of data is sufficient for exploring the Transformer-based language model and its workings. A smaller set of data is also more feasible due to limitations in resources such as computational power and storage, and would still provide meaningful insight into how the AI system functions.
