The phrase "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" refers to the way the ChatGPT AI system works. When you give it text or a prompt, it sees this text as the start of a sequence of words. Based on its learning from a vast number of text data, it then predicts and generates the most likely words that should logically follow the initial sequence, thereby 'completing' the sequence. The 'outcome' here means the set of words or text that the AI generates in response to the given prompt.
