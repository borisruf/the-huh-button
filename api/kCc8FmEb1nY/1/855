In this passage, the author is giving an introduction to the system called ChatGPT, a text-based AI model that can generate human-like text given a particular prompt. They mention how this system can generate multiple responses to a single prompt, making it a probabilistic system. As an example, they ask the AI to generate a news article about a leaf falling from a tree, which it does in a humorous and dramatic fashion. 

The author explains how ChatGPT is a language model, which makes predictions based on preceding word sequences. They discuss how this system evolved from a research paper titled "Attention is All You Need" that proposed the Transformer architecture, a fundamental component of the generatively pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that powers ChatGPT.

There is a brief discussion about how this architecture was initially used for machine translation and later spread to other areas within AI, leading to significant advancements in the field. They mention how they intend to demonstrate the working of the Transformer model using a simpler toy dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. 

Reflecting on the scenario of predicting the next character based on a given sequence, they give a soft introduction to the coding part of their talk, where they will walk the audience through building and training these models using Google Colab, and then generate infinite Shakespeare-like texts. 

The brief "Here, I open the "input." at the end suggests that they are about to start coding these operations interactively.
