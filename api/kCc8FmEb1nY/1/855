In the conclusion of his educational video, Andrej explains his intentions to create a simplified version of ChatGPT utilizing a model called 'Transformers', and train it on a dataset named 'Tiny Shakespeare'. Despite the fact that he can't fully replicate ChatGPT, he assures his viewers that this process will offer valuable educational insights into how such systems function. Andrej further shares that a link to his completed code is available on his GitHub repository, called 'Nano GPT', which provides a basic level of understanding. Lastly, he invites his viewers to follow along with the code he will demonstrate using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook, the link to which he will provide in the video description.
