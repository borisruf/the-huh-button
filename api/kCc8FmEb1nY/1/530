The video presenter, Andrej, proposes training a language model based on the Transformer architecture using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. The aim is to demonstrate how language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, work under the hood. Instead of training on a large piece of the internet like ChatGPT, Andrej will use the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which contains a concatenation of Shakespeare's works in a one megabyte file. The model will be trained to predict characters in a sequence to generate an output that resembles Shakespeare's writing. Andrej has an existing GitHub repository containing the code to train these Transformers, called Nano GPT, that he will rewrite from scratch during this tutorial. His goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how Chat GPT works.
