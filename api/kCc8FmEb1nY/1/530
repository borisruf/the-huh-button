The given passage provides a detailed introduction to ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. The author emphasizes its ability to perform various text-based tasks, generating a variety of outputs for the same prompt due to its probabilistic nature.

The author then dives into the technicalities of the model. He mentions the Transformer architecture, upon which GPT is based, which was proposed in the 2017 paper ‘Attention is All You Need’. Though it was initially used for machine translation, Transformer has since been adopted for numerous AI applications, including the core of Chat GPT.

As a demonstration, the author uses a smaller text database called 'Tiny Shakespeare', containing the complete works of Shakespeare, and trains a character-level language model using a Transformer. The aim is to showcase how the Transformer creates sequences character by character, generating text that mimics Shakespeare’s writing style.

This lecture is part of a series striving to make readers understand the workings of language models like GPT. The author also mentioned that he has provided code to train the Transformer in a GitHub repository called 'nano GPT'.
