A prompt in the context of AI conversation models like ChatGPT refers to the initial input or task given to the AI system. For example, asking ChatGPT to write a haiku about the importance of understanding AI is considered a prompt. The AI system interprets this information and generates a response accordingly. However, since it is a probabilistic system, its responses are not fixed and can slightly vary even with the same prompt, hence showcasing the possibility of multiple outcomes.
