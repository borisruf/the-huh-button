The speaker is explaining the workings of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model. When provided user input (considered as the start of a sequence), the AI uses its understanding of language patterns and context to predict and generate a suitable completion. This action is often based on probability which explains why the same input might yield slightly different outputs each time. This "sequence completion" ability enables it to perform tasks like creating poetry, writing articles and explain complex subjects in simpler terms.
