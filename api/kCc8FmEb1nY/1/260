The context involves training a language model, specifically a character-level language model using a Transformer, on a concatenated file of all Shakespeare's works, known as 'Tiny Shakespeare'. The aim is to understand how a language model is able to generate text by predicting the sequence of characters. Instead of words, this model will compute the probability of each character based on the previous string of characters. It's a simpler, smaller-scale task, but the process is educational to understand how systems like ChatGPT, a more complex language model, works.
