In the provided context, the speaker is elaborating on the workings of ChatGPT, a transformer-based language model, which is able to generate sentences that can respond to prompts in a coherent manner. They explain that, although duplicating the workings of ChatGPT is complex, they aim to demonstrate the core mechanism behind it by building a character-level language model using the Transformer architecture. They will be training this model on a text corpus containing the complete works of Shakespeare. Thus, they intend to create a model that can predict and generate Shakespeare-like text, thereby demonstrating how transformers work. They mention that they have already written the code needed to train these transformers.
