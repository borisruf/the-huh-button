In the context provided, the author discusses ChatGPT, a groundbreaking AI system developed by OpenAI. Being a language model, ChatGPT is pre-trained to understand the flow of words, thus allowing it to generate potential future parts of a text when given the start of a sequence.

Examples are given on how the system can produce different outputs from the same input due to its probabilistic nature. This ability enables unique and versatile responses to textual queries, which could include anything from breaking news articles to haikus.

The paper "Attention is All You Need" is credited for introducing the Transformer architecture, which lies at the heart of the ChatGPT system. This architecture, originally designed for machine translation, has since become a foundational part of many AI applications.

As an educational exercise, the author proposes training a simpler Transformer-based character-level language model using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. This would mimic the process of ChatGPT, predicting the likelihood of the next character in a sequence based on preceding characters.

The workings of this language model, though not as complex as ChatGPT, follow a similar method: given a sequence of words or characters, the model predicts what comes next, thus allowing for the generation of text. This process is reminiscent of how ChatGPT generates its responses, albeit on a considerably less complex level.
