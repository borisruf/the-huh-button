In the given context, "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" refers to the process of using the ChatGPT AI system. The user provides an initial input or prompt (the start of a sequence), and the AI system generates a continuation of that sequence based on learned patterns in language and context. For example, if given an initial sequence like "Explain HTML to me like I'm a dog", the AI system derives the rest of the sequence â€“ that is, it generates a response or continuation that makes sense given the initial prompt.
