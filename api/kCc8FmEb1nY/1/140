This explanation is about GPT, or 'generatively pre-trained Transformer', an AI system designed to model language and complete sequences of text-based tasks, such as writing poems or generating responses to prompts. Itâ€™s a probabilistic system, so it can generate multiple different outcomes for the same prompt. The AI was designed based on the Transformer architecture, first proposed in the landmark paper "Attention is All You Need" in 2017.
