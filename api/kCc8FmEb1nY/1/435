The statement "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome" is referring to the functionality of the language model, such as ChatGPT. This entails feeding the AI model an input, or a sequence of words, and the AI develops a completion based on the data it has been trained on. Essentially, you provide the AI with a prompt, it processes the information, considers the various probable outcomes based on its understanding of languages, sentence structures, and contents it has been trained on, then generates its own unique sequence.
