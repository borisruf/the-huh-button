The "Make More" series mentioned refers to a collection of videos or tutorials made by the speaker, in which they delve into simpler neural network language models like multilevel perceptrons. These are the building blocks of more complex systems like GPT-3. The series serves to introduce and familiarize the viewers to the framework used in language modelingâ€”the concept that allows AI models to predict and generate human-like text, as seen in ChatGPT.
