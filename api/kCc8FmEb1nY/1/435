The phrase "And of course, this can copy-paste to any arbitrary text data set that you like" in this context refers to the ability of the AI system discussed - the Transformer model - to be trained on different types of text data. By 'copy-paste', the speaker means the model's capacity to adapt and learn from any chosen dataset. This means that although the demonstration involved training the model on Shakespearean texts, the same process can be applied to any other text dataset, and the model would attempt to generate results that mimic the style of the given text. The value here is that Transformer models are flexible and adaptable to various language styles and contexts.
