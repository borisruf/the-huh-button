Andrej wants to train a language model using the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset to demonstrate how ChatGPT works. To achieve this, he plans to program a Transformer neural network from scratch and train it on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset. This model will attempt to generate Shakespeare-like text based on patterns it learns from the dataset. Andrej's objective in this exercise is to help viewers understand the internal workings of ChatGPT. Apart from being adept at Python, viewers will also benefit from a basic understanding of calculus, statistics, and ideally familiarity with some of his previous educational content. A notebook containing the code for this project will be made available in the video description for viewers to download and run themselves.
