The speaker is detailing how tokenization works in a language model. Tokenization is the process of converting raw text into a sequence of integers. In the speaker's case, this language model is character-based, meaning individual characters are translated into integers. The speaker creates both an encoder which translates a string into integers and a decoder which takes these integer lists and converts them back to their original string. The lookup tables for these translations are created by iterating over all the characters in their provided dataset. As an example, the speaker demonstrates this process with the string 'hi there', showing its corresponding integer sequence and its accurate conversion back into the original string 'hi there'.
