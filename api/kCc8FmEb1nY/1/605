The phrase "Here, I open the 'input" refers to the line of code where the speaker opens a file for reading. More specifically, they are opening the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, which is a one-megabyte file of all the works of Shakespeare. This data is used to train the machine learning model to understand and generate text in the style of Shakespeare. The speaker doesn't fully read out the code, which would suggest the complete line might read something like "Here, I open the 'input.txt' file," referring to the code to open and read the file containing the dataset.
