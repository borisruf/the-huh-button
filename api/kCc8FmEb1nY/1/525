The speaker is explaining how he is going to create a character-based language model using the Transformer architecture, a type of neural network. He will use Python to treat the text he is working with (all of Shakespeare's works, called Tiny Shakespeare) as a sequence of characters. The transformer will predict what character is likely to come next based on the sequence of characters that came before it. 'A sequence' means an ordered list of items or events. In terms of Python programming, a sequence is a type of data structure where elements are addressed (or 'indexed') by an integer starting from zero for the first element. Thus, a sequence of characters in Python refers to a string data type where each character in the string can be indexed individually. In the context of the speaker's project, he will train a machine learning model to predict the next character in a sequence based on the previously seen characters.
