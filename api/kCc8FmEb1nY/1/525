The speaker in this context explains that they have set up a new Google Colaboratory notebook to start building a simple version of GPT from scratch. They have chosen to work with the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset, given its manageable size and interesting content. They briefly explain that the goal is to train a Transformer neural network, which works by predicting what character comes next in a sequence. They then demonstrate that they have downloaded the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data and are opening it as their input. This process will allow them to demonstrate how the GPT model operates under the hood, mimicking its language processing and predictive functions on an interactively smaller scale.
