This statement is referring to the system ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence that can generate text based on prompts given to it. It describes it as 'remarkable' because of its ability to provide different and creative outputs in response to the same prompts. For example, it can be asked to write a haiku or to generate a dramatic news report about a leaf falling from a tree. It is also a probabilistic system, meaning it can provide multiple different responses to the same prompt.
