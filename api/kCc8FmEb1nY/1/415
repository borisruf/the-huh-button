The statement refers to the possibility of using the mentioned code, which was developed to generatively pre-train a Transformer language model, on any text data set you wish to use. The code in this case was trained on the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data set to predict sequences of characters in Shakespeare's writing style. However, this code or methodology can be adapted for any chosen text data set, meaning it can be copied and pasted accordingly to work with whatever specific data set you want to train the language model on. The language model could then generate text in the style of the author or the nature of the text included in the data set. This 'copy-and-paste' method allows for versatility and flexibility in using the generative pre-training Transformer method to create unique language models based on different text data sets.
