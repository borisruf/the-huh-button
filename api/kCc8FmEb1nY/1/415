The speaker is explaining how the artificial intelligence system, ChatGPT, works. When the speaker says "I give it the start of a sequence, and it completes the sequence with the outcome," it's an explanation of how the AI generates text. The "start of a sequence" refers to the initial prompt or input given to the AI. The AI system, trained on a vast amount of text, predicts what should logically follow this prompt based on patterns it has learned from its training data, thereby "completing the sequence" to produce an output. The AI does not truly understand the content but uses probabilities to predict the next most likely words or phrases.
