The speaker is discussing an AI language model called ChatGPT which generates responses based on given prompts. He illustrates its effectiveness by sharing different responses it offered to the same prompt. He further explains that this tool is based on the Transformer architecture, which was proposed in a 2017 AI paper. The speaker plans to train a similar language model to demonstrate how it works, but on a smaller scale and using character-level predictions within a text by Shakespeare. To facilitate this instructional process, he introduces Nano GPT, a mini version of the GPT model, which he has implemented and made available on GitHub. Users can train Transformers on any given text using Nano GPT's simple code. The speaker also mentions that he has recreated the earliest and smallest parameter model of OpenAI's GPT, demonstrating the effectiveness of his code. The "finished code" in question refers to the code used to create and train GPT in Nano GPT, available for review on GitHub.
