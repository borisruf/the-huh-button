In this excerpt, the speaker is comparing ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence dialogue systems, to the 'transformer' technology he used to develop a character-level language model trained on the works of Shakespeare. To reduce complexity, he used a smaller dataset rather than the entirety of the internet like ChatGPT. The resulting model is capable of generating text that resembles Shakespeare's writing style. The speaker mentions that he has already written the code for training these transformers and made it available in a GitHub repository.
