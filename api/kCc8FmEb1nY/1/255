This excerpt explains how OpenAI's ChatGPT works. As a language model, it's trained to predict and generate text based on the input sequence. It models how words follow each other creating logically coherent text. When you give it a prompt or the start of a sequence, it takes that information and completes the sequence with a probable outcome, based on what it has learned during its training. The result of this process can be a variety of answers generated from the same initial prompt, as the system works on probability. The use-cases are diverse, from writing a haiku or creating a fictional news article to explaining complex concepts in an easy-to-understand manner.
