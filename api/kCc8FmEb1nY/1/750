The last sentence in the transcript is Andrej stating how he downloaded the 'Tiny Shakespeare' dataset from a specific URL. He also mentions that the dataset is a one-megabyte file, and he provides a brief overview of how to open the 'input.txt' document. He intended to use this dataset in a Google Colab Jupyter notebook to develop a Transformer-based language model that resembles the Chat GPT system, but on a smaller and simpler scale. The model will predict the sequence of characters in Shakespearean texts.
