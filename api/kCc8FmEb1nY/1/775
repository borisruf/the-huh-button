The text refers to the process of encoding a dataset for training a language model. In the given context, it is discussing the process of using an encoder and decoder (tokenizers) to convert the entire works of Shakespeare into a form that the artificial intelligence program can use for training. This enables the AI to predict the next character in a sequence based on the characters that come before it. This is significant for teaching the AI about patterns and sequences, effectively allowing it to generate text that appears Shakespearean.
