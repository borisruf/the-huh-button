This is a line from a lecture transcription. The speaker is discussing a Python program they're about to write. This program will read and process data from a file called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. Shortly before this line, they downloaded the data for this file. The line "Here, I open the 'input." is likely the beginning of a sentence where they're pointing to the next step in the program they're creating, referring to the process of opening the downloaded 'Tiny Shakespeare' text file, in order to extract the data and run their machine-learning model on it.
