The final sentence in the transcript reveals that Andrej sets up a new Google Colab Jupyter notebook for programming. He notes that he has already made some preliminary moves, like downloading the 'Tiny Shakespeare' data set from a specified URL. Andrej also explains that this Colab notebook allows him to share the code that will be developed so that viewers of the video can follow along with him as he defines a Transformer neural network and trains it on the Shakespeare data set. This information will be included in the video description for easy access for learners.
