This extract is describing how ChatGPT, an AI model, works. By giving it a sequence of words as a prompt (also known as the start of a sequence), the AI goes through a set of possible outcomes and selects one to complete the sequence. This process is also known as text generation. The results of this can vary, as ChatGPT is a probabilistic system, meaning that it can provide many different possible continuations for a single prompt based on the data it was trained on.
