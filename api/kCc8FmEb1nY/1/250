The speaker talks about the humorous and flexible nature of the AI, then moves to discuss the underlying structure of ChatGPT, drawing attention to the Transformer architecture that is at its core. Then the speaker proposes creating a simpler character-level model as an educational exercise, using the text of all of Shakespeare's works in a single one-megabyte file as the dataset. The speaker aims to elucidate the inner workings of systems like ChatGPT using this simplified model and dataset.
