This context discusses a form of AI called ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) that uses a 'language model'. The language model processes words or tokens in sequence and can generate different responses based on the same input, hence it is known as a probabilistic system. The context explains that the underlying technology of GPT comes from a paper titled "Attention is All You Need" which introduced the Transformer architecture. This AI has been widely used in different applications beyond its original purpose of machine translation. The context then mentions the intention to build a basic version of ChatGPT using a smaller dataset, 'Tiny Shakespeare', to train the AI on how characters follow each other.
