In the video, Andrej explains the functioning of a language model, specifically the ChatGPT. He describes how the system uses a Transformer neural network to model the sequence of words or characters. The Transformer architecture, as Andrej mentions, was proposed in a significant 2017 AI research paper titled "Attention is All You Need". This concept has been incorporated widely in more recent AI applications, including ChatGPT. He emphasizes that he will demonstrate how to build a basic Transformer-based language model using a toy dataset called 'Tiny Shakespeare'. Andrej aims to illustrate the process of training a Transformer to predict the next character in a sequence, thereby creating a system able to generate text that mimics the style of Shakespeare. He further mentions that he has previously written code for training Transformers, which is available in his GitHub repository named 'nano GPT'. He plans to write this repository from scratch in this presentation, using a Google Colab Jupyter notebook. He concludes the introduction by outlining the prerequisites for understanding the process, including a proficiency in Python and basic knowledge of calculus and statistics.
