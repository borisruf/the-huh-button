The speaker is explaining the process of how languages are computed and processed by AI and machine learning algorithms using the example of a system known as Chat GPT. This system offers a language model that is based on the work of Shakespeare which builds on the sequential nature of words. These strings of words are then encoded into a series of integer values that the AI can process. This is done by creating a list of all the possible characters that occur in the dataset, which is then translated into unique integers. A string of text can then be converted into a series of these integer values, which can be processed by the AI to generate new strings of text similar to the original. The speaker also mentions a process called tokenizing, where raw text is converted into a sequence of integers that represent individual characters.
