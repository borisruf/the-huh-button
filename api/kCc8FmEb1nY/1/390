The person is explaining that they've successfully created a program that can train Transformer neural networks on any text input. They have used this code to emulate performance of GPT-2, a language prediction model developed by OpenAI. They have also made this program capable of loading original weights that were used in the OpenAI's neural networks. These weights represent the learned knowledge of the neural network, and being able to load them means that the user can start their work from where OpenAI left off, rather than starting from scratch.
