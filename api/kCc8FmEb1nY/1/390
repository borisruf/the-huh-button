He explains that ChatGPT, a language model, is capable of generating text based on given prompts. The system uses its understanding of the sequence of words in the English language to complete the tasks.

This reveals its probabilistic nature, meaning it can provide several valid responses to the same prompt. The versatility of ChatGPT has led to various creative and humorous applications as demonstrated by numerous examples on websites dedicated to showcasing interactions with the AI system.
