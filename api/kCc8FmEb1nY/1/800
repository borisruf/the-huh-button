The person is going to divide their data set into a train set and a validation set. This is a common practice in machine learning and data science, where the available data is split for different uses. The training set is used to train the model, i.e. to adjust the parameters of the model to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model fit on the training set while tuning the model's hyperparameters. It can be also used for regularization by early stopping, i.e. stop training when the error on the validation set increases as this is a sign of overfitting to the training set. 

Separating data into training and validation sets prevents overfitting, which occurs when a model is overly adapted to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. It makes sure that the model is capable of generalizing to new data and gives an estimate of the performance of the model on an independent dataset. It also helps to assess the effectiveness of the model and tweak it if necessary.
