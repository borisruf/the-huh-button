The speaker is explaining a segment of encoding and training a Transformer-based language model using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. During the process, every character from the dataset is assigned an integer to ensure that the encoded text can be decoded and vice versa. This all happens at a character level. The speaker noted that different tokenization schemas could be used depending on the desired complexity, such as Google's 'sentence piece' used for sub-word tokenization or 'tick token' which is used by OpenAI for a 'pipe pair encoding tokenizer'. However, for the purpose of explaining how the Transformer works under the hood of ChatGPT, they chose to keep the process simple. The next step is to encode the entire Shakespeare dataset, wrapping it in a torch.tensor to get a data tensor. This tensor represents the first 1,000 characters from the dataset.
